Implementing a robust and scalable backend system, such as a web application or a microservice, would be an excellent use case to demonstrate your skills in implementing Java hexagonal architecture. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you could approach it:

1. **Identify the Domain**: Choose a domain for your application. It could be anything from e-commerce, banking, social networking, etc. Let's say you choose an e-commerce platform.
    
2. **Define Domain Models**: Identify the core entities and value objects in your domain. For an e-commerce platform, this might include entities like `User`, `Product`, `Order`, etc.
    
3. **Define Ports and Adapters**: Identify the ports (interfaces) for interacting with your domain logic. This could include interfaces for repositories, services, external services (like payment gateways), etc. Then, implement adapters for these ports. For example:
    
    - `UserRepositoryPort` with adapters like `UserRepositoryMongoAdapter`, `UserRepositoryMySQLAdapter`, etc.
    - `ProductCatalogServicePort` with adapters like `ProductCatalogServiceAPIAdapter`, `ProductCatalogServiceMockAdapter`, etc.
4. **Implement Domain Logic**: Write the core business logic of your application. This logic should be free from any infrastructure concerns and should rely only on the ports defined earlier.
    
5. **Implement Application Services**: These services orchestrate the flow of data between the outer layers (such as the presentation layer or infrastructure layer) and the inner layers (domain layer). They use the ports to interact with the domain logic.
    
6. **Implement Infrastructure Adapters**: Implement the adapters for interacting with external systems or infrastructure components such as databases, external APIs, message brokers, etc.
    
7. **Implement Presentation Layer**: This could be a RESTful API layer, a GraphQL layer, or any other interface through which clients interact with your application. This layer should be thin and delegate most of the work to application services.
    
8. **Implement Tests**: Write unit tests for your domain logic, integration tests for your adapters, and possibly end-to-end tests to ensure everything works together as expected.
    
9. **Deployment**: Deploy your application in a suitable environment. This could be on-premise servers, cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, or containers like Docker.
    
10. **Documentation**: Document your architecture, explaining the rationale behind each design decision and how different components interact with each other.
    

By implementing a project following these steps, you'll demonstrate your understanding and proficiency in implementing hexagonal architecture using Java.
