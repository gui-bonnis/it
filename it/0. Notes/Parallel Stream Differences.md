there is a difference of processing in parallel when using contratos.parallelStream() .filter(c -> c.getId().equals(contrato.getId())) .forEach(c -> contratoRepository.deleteById(c.getContratoId())); and contratos.stream() .filter(c -> c.getId().equals(contrato.getId())) .parallel() .forEach(c -> contratoRepository.deleteById(c.getContratoId()));

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, there is a difference between using `.parallelStream()` and placing `.parallel()` after `.stream()` in the context of parallel processing in Java. Here's the distinction:

### 1. **Using `.parallelStream()`**:

java

Copy code

`contratos.parallelStream()     .filter(c -> c.getId().equals(contrato.getId()))     .forEach(c -> contratoRepository.deleteById(c.getContratoId()));`

- **Parallelism Scope**: When you start with `.parallelStream()`, the entire stream pipeline is processed in parallel. This means that all operations, including the filtering and the `forEach`, are executed concurrently across multiple threads.
- **Thread Management**: The Java runtime decides how to parallelize the work based on the underlying thread pool. This can significantly improve performance when dealing with large datasets, as multiple elements are processed simultaneously.

### 2. **Using `.parallel()` after `.stream()`**:

java

Copy code

`contratos.stream()     .filter(c -> c.getId().equals(contrato.getId()))     .parallel()     .forEach(c -> contratoRepository.deleteById(c.getContratoId()));`

- **Parallelism Scope**: When you first create a sequential stream with `.stream()` and then call `.parallel()`, only the operations following `.parallel()` are executed in parallel. In this case, the filtering operation happens sequentially, and only the `forEach` operation runs in parallel.
- **Impact on Execution**: This can lead to different performance characteristics, as the filtering operation might become a bottleneck if it's computationally expensive or if the stream is large. The parallel processing only kicks in after the filter step.

### Summary:

- **`parallelStream()`**: Parallelizes the entire stream pipeline.
- **`stream().parallel()`**: Parallelizes only the operations after the `.parallel()` call.

If your goal is to optimize performance by utilizing parallel processing, typically starting with `.parallelStream()` is the preferred approach. However, if you need control over when parallelism is introduced, you might opt for `.stream().parallel()`.

how can I delete in JPA a list of Ids using @query

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To delete a list of entities by their IDs using a custom `@Query` annotation in JPA, you can create a method in your repository interface that uses a JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) or native SQL query. Here's how you can do it:

### 1. **Using JPQL with `@Query`**:

You can define a `DELETE` query using JPQL like this:

java

Copy code

`import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Modifying; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query; import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository; import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;  public interface ContratoRepository extends CrudRepository<Contrato, Long> {      @Modifying     @Transactional     @Query("DELETE FROM Contrato c WHERE c.id IN :ids")     void deleteByIds(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids); }`

### Explanation:

- **`@Modifying`**: Indicates that this query will modify the data (i.e., it's not a `SELECT` query).
- **`@Transactional`**: Ensures that the operation is performed within a transaction, so it either fully succeeds or fails without partial completion.
- **`@Param("ids")`**: Binds the `ids` parameter to the list of IDs passed to the method.

### 2. **Using Native SQL with `@Query`**:

Alternatively, you can use a native SQL query:

java

Copy code

`import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Modifying; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query; import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository; import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;  public interface ContratoRepository extends CrudRepository<Contrato, Long> {      @Modifying     @Transactional     @Query(value = "DELETE FROM contrato WHERE id IN :ids", nativeQuery = true)     void deleteByIdsNative(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids); }`

### Explanation:

- **`nativeQuery = true`**: Specifies that the query is a native SQL query rather than a JPQL query.
- **SQL Syntax**: The query uses standard SQL syntax, which might differ slightly depending on the database you're using.

### Usage Example:

java

Copy code

`List<Long> idsToDelete = Arrays.asList(1L, 2L, 3L); contratoRepository.deleteByIds(idsToDelete);`

This will delete all entities with IDs in the `idsToDelete` list from the database.

How to group by using streams, in my case I want to group by to properties of my class and the process each group separetly and them process each element of each group individualy

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To group a collection of objects by two properties using Java Streams, and then process each group separately, you can use the `Collectors.groupingBy()` method. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Step 1: Define the Class with the Properties

Suppose you have a class `Contrato` with two properties, `property1` and `property2`, by which you want to group:

java

Copy code

`public class Contrato {     private String property1;     private String property2;     private Long contratoId;      // Constructors, getters, setters, etc. }`

### Step 2: Grouping by Two Properties

You can use `Collectors.groupingBy()` to group by a combination of two properties. One way to achieve this is by creating a composite key, which could be a simple `Map.Entry` or a custom key class.

#### Example Using `Map.Entry` as a Composite Key:

java

Copy code

`import java.util.*; import java.util.stream.Collectors;  public class GroupByExample {      public static void main(String[] args) {         List<Contrato> contratos = //... initialize your list of Contrato          // Group by property1 and property2 using a composite key         Map<Map.Entry<String, String>, List<Contrato>> groupedByTwoProperties = contratos.stream()             .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(c -> new AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>(c.getProperty1(), c.getProperty2())));          // Process each group separately         groupedByTwoProperties.forEach((key, group) -> {             System.out.println("Processing group for key: " + key);              // Process each element within the group             group.forEach(contrato -> {                 System.out.println("Processing contrato with ID: " + contrato.getContratoId());                 // Do something with each contrato             });         });     } }`

### Explanation:

1. **Composite Key Creation**: We create a composite key using `AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>(c.getProperty1(), c.getProperty2())` to combine the two properties. This is used as the key for grouping in the resulting map.
    
2. **Grouping by Composite Key**: The `Collectors.groupingBy()` method groups the elements by this composite key, returning a `Map` where the key is the composite of `property1` and `property2`, and the value is a `List<Contrato>` containing the elements of that group.
    
3. **Processing Each Group**: The `forEach()` method is used to iterate over each group. The `key` represents the group key (the composite of `property1` and `property2`), and the `group` represents the list of `Contrato` objects in that group.
    
4. **Processing Each Element**: Inside each group, another `forEach()` is used to process individual elements.
    

### Custom Key Class (Alternative Approach):

If you prefer a more readable solution, you can create a custom key class:

java

Copy code

`public class GroupKey {     private String property1;     private String property2;      // Constructor, getters, equals(), hashCode(), toString()... }`

Then, use it like this:

java

Copy code

`Map<GroupKey, List<Contrato>> groupedByTwoProperties = contratos.stream()     .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(c -> new GroupKey(c.getProperty1(), c.getProperty2())));`

### Summary:

This approach allows you to group by multiple properties, process each group, and then process each individual element within those groups. The key can be created using a simple composite (like `Map.Entry`) or a custom class to enhance readability and maintainability.

I'm getting error: Could not resolve target entity 'TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES' this is my query @Transactional @Query("DELETE FROM TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES a WHERE a.ALUNO_CHANGES_ID IN :ids") void deleteByIds(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The error `Could not resolve target entity 'TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES'` indicates that JPA is unable to locate the entity class corresponding to the table `TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES`. This typically happens because JPA is expecting an entity class rather than a direct reference to a table name in the query.

### Resolving the Issue

1. **Entity Name vs. Table Name**: In JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language), you refer to entities by their class names, not by their database table names. If you have an entity class representing the `TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES` table, you should use the entity class name instead of the table name.
    
2. **Correcting the Query**:
    
    - Let's assume you have an entity class named `AlunoDmlChanges` mapped to the table `TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES`.
    - The query should reference the entity class, not the table.
    
    Here's how you should structure the query:
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Modifying; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query; import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository; import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;  public interface AlunoDmlChangesRepository extends CrudRepository<AlunoDmlChanges, Long> {      @Modifying     @Transactional     @Query("DELETE FROM AlunoDmlChanges a WHERE a.alunoChangesId IN :ids")     void deleteByIds(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids); }`
    
3. **Entity Class Example**: Ensure that your entity class is correctly defined and annotated:
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `import javax.persistence.Entity; import javax.persistence.Id; import javax.persistence.Table;  @Entity @Table(name = "ALUNO_DML_CHANGES", schema = "TOTVS") public class AlunoDmlChanges {      @Id     private Long alunoChangesId;      // other fields, getters, setters }`
    
4. **Native Query (Alternative)**: If you really need to use the table name directly (e.g., in a legacy system or for specific reasons), you can use a native query:
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `@Modifying @Transactional @Query(value = "DELETE FROM TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES WHERE ALUNO_CHANGES_ID IN :ids", nativeQuery = true) void deleteByIdsNative(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);`
    
    - This tells Spring Data JPA to treat the query as native SQL rather than JPQL, allowing direct use of table names.

### Summary:

- **JPQL queries**: Use the entity class name, not the table name.
- **Native queries**: Use `nativeQuery = true` if you need to reference the actual database table name directly.

This should resolve the error you're encountering.

##### You said:

when doing the delete I'm getting the error RA-01002: extração fora de sequência

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The error `RA-01002: extração fora de sequência` (which translates to "extraction out of sequence" or "fetch out of sequence") typically occurs in Oracle databases when the results of a query are fetched after the cursor has been closed or the query is being executed in a way that is inconsistent with the expected sequence of operations.

This issue can happen in various situations, but since you're dealing with a `DELETE` operation in JPA, here are some possible causes and solutions:

### 1. **Uncommitted Transactions**

- **Issue**: If there's an uncommitted transaction, the database might be trying to manage resources (like cursors) for a prolonged period, leading to this error.
- **Solution**: Ensure that all operations within your transactions are properly committed. Since you're using the `@Transactional` annotation, the transaction should commit automatically, but it's worth checking if any other operations are interfering with the transaction.

### 2. **Query Execution Order**

- **Issue**: This error might occur if there's a mismatch in the sequence of operations in the database, such as trying to perform a delete operation while there are still pending fetch operations.
- **Solution**: Ensure that there are no pending queries or fetch operations that might be conflicting with the `DELETE` operation. Make sure the `deleteByIds` method is not being called in parallel or in a context where the transaction is being interrupted.

### 3. **Cursor Management in Oracle**

- **Issue**: Oracle manages cursors for queries, and this error can occur if the cursor is used after it's closed or if there's an issue with how the cursor is being handled in the transaction.
- **Solution**: If you're using Oracle-specific features or dealing with large datasets, you might want to review how the query is executed. It might help to break down the operation into smaller parts or ensure that the query is optimized.

### 4. **Batch Processing with JPA**

- **Issue**: JPA might be trying to batch multiple delete operations together, which can sometimes lead to issues with Oracle's cursor management.
- **Solution**: You can try disabling batch processing for this particular operation by configuring the `@Modifying` annotation with a `clearAutomatically` attribute:

java

Copy code

`@Modifying(clearAutomatically = true) @Transactional @Query("DELETE FROM AlunoDmlChanges a WHERE a.alunoChangesId IN :ids") void deleteByIds(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);`

### 5. **Switching to Native Query**

- If you're still facing issues, consider switching to a native query as a workaround:

java

Copy code

`@Modifying @Transactional @Query(value = "DELETE FROM TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES WHERE ALUNO_CHANGES_ID IN :ids", nativeQuery = true) void deleteByIdsNative(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);`

### Debugging Steps:

- **Check Oracle Logs**: Look at the Oracle logs for more details on the exact cause of the error.
- **Transaction Isolation**: Check if there are any transaction isolation issues that could be causing a conflict.
- **Simplify the Operation**: Try simplifying the query or operation to isolate the issue. For example, delete records in smaller batches or try deleting a single record to see if the problem persists.

By addressing these areas, you should be able to resolve or at least identify the root cause of the `RA-01002` error during the delete operation.

org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaSystemException: A problem occurred in the SQL executor : Error advancing (next) ResultSet position [ORA-01002: extração fora de sequência ]

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The error you're encountering, `org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaSystemException: A problem occurred in the SQL executor: Error advancing (next) ResultSet position [ORA-01002: extração fora de sequência]`, occurs in Oracle databases when there's an issue with how the database cursor is managed during query execution, particularly when trying to advance the cursor (e.g., when using `next()` on a `ResultSet`). This problem is specific to Oracle and can be triggered by various issues in JPA/Hibernate, transaction management, or even the database itself.

### Common Causes and Solutions

#### 1. **Improper Transaction Management**

- **Cause**: If a transaction is not managed properly (e.g., opened but not committed or rolled back), Oracle might lose track of the cursor's position.
- **Solution**: Ensure that the `@Transactional` annotation is used correctly and that transactions are committed or rolled back as needed. Double-check any manual transaction management to ensure consistency.

java

Copy code

`@Modifying @Transactional @Query("DELETE FROM AlunoDmlChanges a WHERE a.alunoChangesId IN :ids") void deleteByIds(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);`

#### 2. **Cursor Management Issues in Oracle**

- **Cause**: The `ORA-01002` error can also be triggered by issues with Oracle's cursor management, particularly if you're running a query that opens and closes cursors implicitly.
- **Solution**: Ensure that your query is not being interrupted or that the cursor is not prematurely closed. This could happen if other operations are interfering with the ongoing transaction.

#### 3. **Batch Processing or Fetching Large Data Sets**

- **Cause**: If your query involves large datasets, and there is batch processing or eager fetching involved, it might result in cursor-related issues.
- **Solution**: Consider breaking down the delete operation into smaller chunks, or disable batch processing:

java

Copy code

`@Modifying(clearAutomatically = true) @Transactional @Query("DELETE FROM AlunoDmlChanges a WHERE a.alunoChangesId IN :ids") void deleteByIds(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);`

#### 4. **Switching to Native SQL Query**

- **Cause**: Sometimes, the issue lies in how JPA/Hibernate translates JPQL into SQL, especially with complex or non-standard SQL operations.
- **Solution**: Use a native SQL query to have more direct control over the SQL being executed:

java

Copy code

`@Modifying @Transactional @Query(value = "DELETE FROM TOTVS.ALUNO_DML_CHANGES WHERE ALUNO_CHANGES_ID IN :ids", nativeQuery = true) void deleteByIdsNative(@Param("ids") List<Long> ids);`

#### 5. **Ensure Correct Mapping and Usage**

- **Cause**: If there's an issue with how the entity is mapped or how the query is being executed, it could lead to cursor issues.
- **Solution**: Ensure that your entity class is correctly mapped to the database table and that there are no conflicts in the way JPA is managing the entity lifecycle.

java

Copy code

`@Entity @Table(name = "ALUNO_DML_CHANGES", schema = "TOTVS") public class AlunoDmlChanges {     @Id     private Long alunoChangesId;     // other fields, getters, setters }`

#### 6. **Check Database Session or Connection Pooling**

- **Cause**: Issues with database session or connection pooling could lead to cursor-related errors, especially if connections are prematurely closed or reused incorrectly.
- **Solution**: Review your connection pool configuration and ensure that database sessions are handled correctly.

### Debugging Steps

1. **Enable SQL Logging**: Enable SQL logging in your application to see the exact SQL statements being executed. This can help you understand what happens just before the error is thrown.
    
2. **Check Database Logs**: Review Oracle database logs for more detailed error information. Sometimes the database log can give more insight into what is causing the cursor to go out of sequence.
    
3. **Test with Simplified Query**: Try executing a simplified version of the query (or even directly in the database) to see if the error persists. This can help isolate whether the problem is with the query itself or something specific to how JPA/Hibernate is executing it.
    

By carefully reviewing these areas, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the `ORA-01002` error in your JPA query.

how can I get top 40 items in a stream?

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To get the top 40 items in a Java Stream, you can use the `Stream` API combined with the `limit()` method. The `limit(long maxSize)` method allows you to specify the maximum number of items to retain in the stream, effectively truncating the stream to the first `n` elements.

Here's how you can do it:

### Example

java

Copy code

`import java.util.List; import java.util.stream.Collectors; import java.util.stream.Stream;  public class TopItemsExample {     public static void main(String[] args) {         // Example stream, could be from a list or any other source         Stream<String> itemsStream = Stream.of("item1", "item2", "item3", /*... up to n items */ "item50");          // Get the top 40 items from the stream         List<String> top40Items = itemsStream                 .limit(40) // Limit the stream to the first 40 items                 .collect(Collectors.toList()); // Collect the results into a list          // Print the top 40 items         top40Items.forEach(System.out::println);     } }`

### Explanation:

- **`Stream.of("item1", "item2", ...)`**: Creates a stream of items. Replace this with your actual data source, such as a list or a database query.
    
- **`limit(40)`**: Limits the stream to the first 40 elements. If the stream contains fewer than 40 elements, it will return all available elements without error.
    
- **`collect(Collectors.toList())`**: Collects the results of the stream operation into a `List`. You can also collect into other collections or process the elements directly depending on your use case.
    

### Notes:

- **Order Preservation**: If the order of the elements matters (e.g., if you want the "top" 40 items based on their order in the stream), make sure the stream is ordered before applying `limit()`.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: If you need to filter or sort the items before limiting to the top 40, you can chain other stream operations such as `filter()` or `sorted()` before the `limit()` operation.

### Example with Filtering and Sorting:

java

Copy code

`import java.util.Comparator; import java.util.List; import java.util.stream.Collectors; import java.util.stream.Stream;  public class TopItemsExample {     public static void main(String[] args) {         Stream<String> itemsStream = Stream.of("item1", "item2", "item3", /*...*/ "item50");          // Get the top 40 items after sorting and filtering         List<String> top40Items = itemsStream                 .filter(item -> item.startsWith("item")) // Example filter                 .sorted(Comparator.naturalOrder()) // Sort alphabetically or any custom logic                 .limit(40) // Limit to the top 40 items                 .collect(Collectors.toList());          top40Items.forEach(System.out::println);     } }`

This approach ensures that you can efficiently retrieve the top 40 items from any stream of data.
