I have an Spring boot application with Java and JPA. It connects to PostgreSQL. I'm having error when I try to connect to Postgres from another tool like DBeaver, the reason is too may connections active. Please can you help me to understand why my application is consumming all connections in the pool and how I can check whether the error is?

When your Spring Boot application with JPA is consuming all available connections to your PostgreSQL database, it typically indicates that connections are not being properly released back to the pool. This can lead to "too many connections" errors when other tools, like DBeaver, attempt to connect.

Here's a systematic approach to diagnose and resolve the issue:

### Step 1: Check Connection Pool Configuration

Ensure that your connection pool is configured properly in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. Common connection pool libraries used with Spring Boot are HikariCP, Tomcat JDBC, and Apache DBCP.

#### For HikariCP (default in Spring Boot 2+):

properties

Copy code

`spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10 spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=5 spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=30000 spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime=600000 spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000`

#### For Tomcat JDBC:

properties

Copy code

`spring.datasource.tomcat.max-active=10 spring.datasource.tomcat.max-idle=5 spring.datasource.tomcat.min-idle=2 spring.datasource.tomcat.initial-size=5 spring.datasource.tomcat.max-wait=10000`

### Step 2: Monitor Connection Pool Usage

Enable logging for your connection pool to monitor how connections are being used. This can help you identify if connections are being leaked.

#### HikariCP:

properties

Copy code

`logging.level.com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig=DEBUG logging.level.com.zaxxer.hikari=TRACE`

### Step 3: Investigate Connection Leaks

A common cause of connection leaks is forgetting to close the connections. With Spring Data JPA, this should be handled automatically, but custom JDBC code might need explicit connection closure.

1. **Custom JDBC Code**: Ensure every `Connection`, `Statement`, and `ResultSet` is closed in a `finally` block or using try-with-resources.
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection();      PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("your_query");      ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()) {     // Process results } catch (SQLException e) {     // Handle exception }`
    
2. **Long-running Transactions**: Long-running transactions can hold onto connections. Check for any transactions that take a long time to complete.
    

### Step 4: Use a Connection Pool Leak Detection Tool

Some connection pool implementations provide leak detection mechanisms.

#### HikariCP:

properties

Copy code

`spring.datasource.hikari.leakDetectionThreshold=2000  # 2 seconds`

### Step 5: Database Configuration

Ensure your PostgreSQL database is configured to handle the number of connections your application requires. Check the `max_connections` setting in your PostgreSQL configuration (`postgresql.conf`).

### Step 6: Analyze Application Logs

Check your application logs for any exceptions or warnings related to database connections. This can provide clues about why connections are not being returned to the pool.

### Step 7: Use a Monitoring Tool

Tools like p6spy or Spring Boot Actuator can help monitor and diagnose connection pool issues.

#### Spring Boot Actuator:

Add the dependency in `pom.xml`:

xml

Copy code

`<dependency>     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId> </dependency>`

Then, enable the endpoints in `application.properties`:

properties

Copy code

`management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`

You can then access the actuator endpoints (e.g., `/actuator/metrics/hikaricp.connections`) to monitor the state of your connection pool.

### Example: Checking Connection Usage via Actuator

Access the actuator endpoint to see the current state of your connection pool:

bash

Copy code

`http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/hikaricp.connections`

This provides information on active, idle, and total connections in the pool.

By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue of your application consuming all available database connections.

I have spring boot 3.3 and these are the configurations that I have for postgres connection using JPA: postgresql: datasource: driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver poolSize: 1 username: XX password: XX jdbcUrl: XX hibernate: dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Based on the configuration you've shared, it seems like your connection pool size is set to 1, which is unusually low and might be causing issues under load. The pool size setting determines the maximum number of connections that can be allocated from the pool at a given time. Increasing this value should help in handling more simultaneous requests and avoiding connection exhaustion.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed and comprehensive configuration for PostgreSQL using HikariCP, which is the default connection pool used by Spring Boot 3.x:

### Recommended Configuration in `application.yml`:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver     url: jdbc:postgresql://<hostname>:<port>/<database>     username: your_username     password: your_password     hikari:       maximum-pool-size: 10       # Maximum number of connections in the pool       minimum-idle: 5             # Minimum number of idle connections in the pool       idle-timeout: 30000         # Max time (milliseconds) that a connection is allowed to sit idle       max-lifetime: 1800000       # Max lifetime (milliseconds) of a connection in the pool       connection-timeout: 30000   # Max time (milliseconds) to wait for a connection from the pool       leak-detection-threshold: 2000  # Time (milliseconds) to detect connection leaks   jpa:     hibernate:       ddl-auto: update     properties:       hibernate:         dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect         show_sql: true            # Enable logging of generated SQL (for debugging)         format_sql: true          # Format SQL in the logs (for readability)`

### Detailed Steps to Troubleshoot and Resolve Connection Issues:

1. **Increase Connection Pool Size**:
    
    - Setting `maximum-pool-size` to 10 (or higher based on your application's requirements) helps in handling more simultaneous connections.
2. **Monitor Connection Pool Usage**:
    
    - Enable detailed logging for HikariCP to monitor how connections are being used and detect potential leaks.
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `logging:   level:     com.zaxxer.hikari: DEBUG`
    
3. **Analyze and Detect Connection Leaks**:
    
    - Use the `leak-detection-threshold` setting to help identify if connections are not being returned to the pool.
4. **Ensure Proper Resource Management**:
    
    - Verify that all database interactions close connections properly, especially if you are using raw JDBC connections outside of Spring Data JPA.
5. **Enable Spring Boot Actuator**:
    
    - Spring Boot Actuator provides insights into the state of your application, including the connection pool.
    
    xml
    
    Copy code
    
    `<dependency>     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId> </dependency>`
    
    - Configure the endpoints:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `management:   endpoints:     web:       exposure:         include: '*'`
    
    - Access the actuator metrics endpoint to check the status of your connection pool:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/hikaricp.connections`
        
6. **PostgreSQL Configuration**:
    
    - Ensure that the PostgreSQL server is configured to handle the number of connections your application requires. Check and increase the `max_connections` setting in your PostgreSQL configuration (`postgresql.conf`) if necessary.

### Example Configuration for `application.yml`:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver     url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database     username: your_username     password: your_password     hikari:       maximum-pool-size: 10       # Adjust as necessary       minimum-idle: 5       idle-timeout: 30000       max-lifetime: 1800000       connection-timeout: 30000       leak-detection-threshold: 2000   jpa:     hibernate:       ddl-auto: update     properties:       hibernate:         dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect         show_sql: true         format_sql: true  logging:   level:     com.zaxxer.hikari: DEBUG`

By following these recommendations, you should be able to better manage the database connections and avoid running into the "too many connections" error. Ensure that your application and database configurations are tuned to handle the expected load effectively.

##### You said:

I'm getting this error when I try to access the url http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/hikaricp.connections pringframework.web.servlet.resource.NoResourceFoundException: No static resource favicon.ico.

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The error message you're seeing, `NoResourceFoundException: No static resource favicon.ico`, is unrelated to accessing the Actuator endpoints. This error typically occurs when the browser requests a favicon and none is available in your application.

To address the issue with accessing the Actuator metrics for HikariCP connections, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Ensure Actuator Dependency is Included

First, make sure you have the Spring Boot Actuator dependency included in your `pom.xml`:

xml

Copy code

`<dependency>     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId> </dependency>`

### Step 2: Enable Actuator Endpoints in `application.yml`

Configure the Actuator endpoints to ensure that the `/metrics` endpoint is enabled and exposed:

yaml

Copy code

`management:   endpoints:     web:       exposure:         include: "*"`

### Step 3: Access the Actuator Endpoints

Try accessing the Actuator endpoints again:

bash

Copy code

`http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/hikaricp.connections`

If you still encounter issues, it may be useful to start with the general `/actuator` endpoint to verify that the Actuator is properly configured and running:

bash

Copy code

`http://localhost:8080/actuator`

This should list all available Actuator endpoints. You can then check if the `/metrics` endpoint is available and proceed to view specific metrics.

### Step 4: Verify HikariCP Metrics are Available

Ensure that the HikariCP metrics are actually being captured by Actuator. You can view all metrics to find relevant HikariCP metrics:

bash

Copy code

`http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics`

This endpoint will list all available metrics, and you should see entries related to HikariCP, such as `hikaricp.connections`.

### Step 5: Handle `favicon.ico` Request

To resolve the `NoResourceFoundException` for `favicon.ico`, you can either:

1. **Provide a favicon**: Add a favicon to your project. Place the favicon.ico file in the `src/main/resources/static` directory.
    
2. **Suppress the Error**: If you don't need a favicon and want to suppress the error, you can ignore requests for it. This can be done by creating a controller or a web configuration to handle the request gracefully.
    

### Example Configuration to Suppress `favicon.ico` Error:

Create a `WebMvcConfig` class to handle requests for `favicon.ico`:

java

Copy code

`import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.ResourceHandlerRegistry; import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;  @Configuration public class WebMvcConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {      @Override     public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {         registry.addResourceHandler("/favicon.ico")                 .addResourceLocations("classpath:/static/favicon.ico");     } }`

Or, alternatively, create a simple controller:

java

Copy code

`import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;  @RestController public class FaviconController {      @GetMapping("favicon.ico")     public void favicon() {         // No-op method to avoid 404 for favicon.ico requests     } }`

### Complete Example of `application.yml`:

Here is a complete example of `application.yml` with all the necessary configurations:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver     url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database     username: your_username     password: your_password     hikari:       maximum-pool-size: 10       minimum-idle: 5       idle-timeout: 30000       max-lifetime: 1800000       connection-timeout: 30000       leak-detection-threshold: 2000   jpa:     hibernate:       ddl-auto: update     properties:       hibernate:         dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect         show_sql: true         format_sql: true  management:   endpoints:     web:       exposure:         include: "*"  logging:   level:     com.zaxxer.hikari: DEBUG`

By following these steps, you should be able to access the Actuator metrics for HikariCP and handle the `favicon.ico` error appropriately.

I 'm seeing this error mensagem when I try to connect in to postgres with dbeaver: HikariPool-1 - Failed to create/setup connectino: FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The error message `FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser connections` indicates that all available connections to the PostgreSQL database are in use, leaving no connection slots available for new connections, including those from tools like DBeaver.

Here's how to diagnose and resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Check PostgreSQL Configuration

1. **max_connections**: This setting in PostgreSQL determines the maximum number of concurrent connections allowed. You may need to increase this value.
    
    Open your `postgresql.conf` file and look for the `max_connections` setting:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo nano /etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf`
    
    Increase the `max_connections` value:
    
    conf
    
    Copy code
    
    `max_connections = 200  # or any appropriate number based on your requirements`
    
    Restart PostgreSQL for the changes to take effect:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo service postgresql restart`
    

### Step 2: Optimize Connection Pooling in Your Application

Ensure your Spring Boot application is not exhausting the connections. Adjust the HikariCP connection pool settings as needed.

### Step 3: Diagnose and Fix Connection Leaks

Make sure your application is properly closing connections. If there are connection leaks, it can quickly exhaust the connection pool.

#### Example Configuration for `application.yml`:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver     url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database     username: your_username     password: your_password     hikari:       maximum-pool-size: 10       # Increase this as necessary       minimum-idle: 5       idle-timeout: 30000       max-lifetime: 1800000       connection-timeout: 30000       leak-detection-threshold: 2000   jpa:     hibernate:       ddl-auto: update     properties:       hibernate:         dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect         show_sql: true         format_sql: true  management:   endpoints:     web:       exposure:         include: "*"  logging:   level:     com.zaxxer.hikari: DEBUG`

### Step 4: Monitor and Manage Active Connections

Use PostgreSQL queries to monitor active connections:

sql

Copy code

`SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;`

This will list all active connections and their statuses. Look for any long-running queries or connections that should have been closed but are still active.

### Step 5: Implement Connection Pool Leak Detection

Enable leak detection to identify any potential connection leaks in your application:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     hikari:       leak-detection-threshold: 2000  # Time in milliseconds (2 seconds)`

### Step 6: Graceful Handling of Connections

Ensure all database operations in your application are properly closing connections, statements, and result sets. This is particularly important for custom JDBC code.

#### Example of Proper Resource Management:

Using try-with-resources in Java:

java

Copy code

`try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection();      PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM your_table");      ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery()) {     // Process results } catch (SQLException e) {     // Handle exception }`

### Step 7: Actuator and Metrics

Use Spring Boot Actuator to monitor the health and metrics of your application, including the connection pool.

1. Add the Actuator dependency in your `pom.xml`:
    
    xml
    
    Copy code
    
    `<dependency>     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId> </dependency>`
    
2. Enable relevant endpoints in `application.yml`:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `management:   endpoints:     web:       exposure:         include: "*"`
    
3. Access Actuator endpoints:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/hikaricp.connections`
    

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Spring Boot application is not exhausting the PostgreSQL connection pool and that connections are being managed efficiently.

I'm using JPA with simple CRUD operations without joins and only 1 transaction (for update a list of 10 elements), I'm having a hard time trying to understand why I have this problem once my context is fairly simple

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Given that your context is simple, using JPA for basic CRUD operations and a single transaction to update a list of 10 elements, it should not typically lead to connection exhaustion. Here are some steps and considerations to help diagnose and resolve the issue:

### Step 1: Review Connection Pool Configuration

Ensure your connection pool configuration is appropriate for your applicationâ€™s needs. Given the simplicity of your operations, a reasonable starting point might be:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver     url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database     username: your_username     password: your_password     hikari:       maximum-pool-size: 10       # Increase if necessary       minimum-idle: 5       idle-timeout: 30000         # 30 seconds       max-lifetime: 1800000       # 30 minutes       connection-timeout: 30000   # 30 seconds       leak-detection-threshold: 2000  # 2 seconds   jpa:     hibernate:       ddl-auto: update     properties:       hibernate:         dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect         show_sql: true         format_sql: true  logging:   level:     com.zaxxer.hikari: DEBUG`

### Step 2: Monitor Active Connections

Use PostgreSQL to monitor active connections and see if connections are being held longer than expected. This can help identify if connections are not being released properly.

sql

Copy code

`SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;`

### Step 3: Check for Connection Leaks

1. **Ensure Proper Closing of Resources**:
    
    - Verify that all database interactions, especially any custom JDBC code, are properly closing connections, statements, and result sets.
2. **Enable Leak Detection**:
    
    - The `leak-detection-threshold` in HikariCP is set to 2 seconds in the configuration above. This will log a warning if a connection is not returned to the pool within 2 seconds of being borrowed.

### Step 4: Analyze Application Logs

Check your application logs for any signs of connection leaks or other issues related to database interactions. Look for warnings or errors related to HikariCP.

### Step 5: Simplify and Test

1. **Isolate Transactions**:
    
    - Test individual CRUD operations to see if any specific operation is causing the issue. This helps isolate the problematic code.
2. **Check the Update Transaction**:
    
    - Ensure the transaction updating the list of 10 elements is not causing the problem. Use logging to track the start and end of the transaction.

### Step 6: Use Spring Boot Actuator

Enable and use Spring Boot Actuator to monitor your application's health and metrics, including the HikariCP connection pool.

1. **Add Actuator Dependency**:
    
    xml
    
    Copy code
    
    `<dependency>     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId> </dependency>`
    
2. **Configure Actuator Endpoints**:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `management:   endpoints:     web:       exposure:         include: "*"`
    
3. **Access Actuator Metrics**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/hikaricp.connections`
    

### Example Transaction Management

Ensure your transactional method is properly defined and handled:

java

Copy code

`@Service public class YourService {      @Autowired     private YourRepository yourRepository;      @Transactional     public void updateElements(List<Element> elements) {         for (Element element : elements) {             // Perform update operation             yourRepository.save(element);         }     } }`

### Step 7: Database Configuration

Ensure your PostgreSQL server has enough connections available. The default `max_connections` setting may be too low for your needs.

1. **Check max_connections**:
    
    sql
    
    Copy code
    
    `SHOW max_connections;`
    
2. **Increase max_connections** if necessary by editing `postgresql.conf` and restarting PostgreSQL:
    
    conf
    
    Copy code
    
    `max_connections = 200  # or an appropriate number`
    
3. **Restart PostgreSQL**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo service postgresql restart`
    

### Step 8: Review Database Access Patterns

Ensure that your application is not inadvertently creating multiple connections for what should be a single transaction. Each interaction with the database should ideally reuse the existing transactionâ€™s connection.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of your connection issues. Start by ensuring your connection pool configuration is adequate, monitor active connections, and check for leaks. Use Spring Boot Actuator to gain insights into the health and metrics of your application, and ensure proper transaction management.

##### You said:

there is any hikari configuration for max-idle?

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

HikariCP does not have a direct configuration parameter named `max-idle`. Instead, HikariCP manages the minimum number of idle connections through the `minimumIdle` parameter and controls the maximum number of connections in the pool through the `maximumPoolSize` parameter.

Here's how you can configure these parameters in your Spring Boot application using `application.yml`:

### Example Configuration

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver     url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database     username: your_username     password: your_password     hikari:       maximum-pool-size: 10         # Maximum number of connections in the pool       minimum-idle: 5               # Minimum number of idle connections in the pool       idle-timeout: 30000           # Maximum time (milliseconds) that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool       max-lifetime: 1800000         # Maximum lifetime (milliseconds) of a connection in the pool       connection-timeout: 30000     # Maximum time (milliseconds) to wait for a connection from the pool       leak-detection-threshold: 2000  # Time (milliseconds) to detect connection leaks`

### Explanation of Key Parameters

- `maximum-pool-size`: The maximum number of connections that the pool can hold. If you hit this limit, your application will wait for an available connection.
- `minimum-idle`: The minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP tries to maintain in the pool. These connections are available for immediate use.
- `idle-timeout`: The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction.
- `max-lifetime`: The maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool (in milliseconds). Connections older than this will be closed and removed from the pool.
- `connection-timeout`: The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) that the pool will wait for a connection to be available before throwing an exception.
- `leak-detection-threshold`: The amount of time (in milliseconds) that a connection can be out of the pool before a message is logged indicating a possible connection leak.

### Adjusting for Your Needs

Given that your application is fairly simple with basic CRUD operations, you might not need a very large connection pool. However, you should ensure that the pool size and idle settings match your application's concurrency requirements and the capacity of your PostgreSQL server.

### Monitoring and Adjustments

After configuring these settings, monitor your application's behavior and database performance. Adjust the parameters as needed based on the observed usage patterns and load.

### Conclusion

HikariCP manages idle connections through `minimumIdle` and `maximumPoolSize` parameters, along with `idle-timeout` for idle connection eviction. Ensure your configurations are tailored to your application's needs and monitor performance to make necessary adjustments. This should help prevent issues related to connection exhaustion and improve overall efficiency.
