Can you give an example of gradle composite build for java multi module project

Certainly! A Gradle composite build is a way to include multiple Gradle projects as dependencies in another Gradle project. This is particularly useful for multi-module projects where you might want to work on multiple modules simultaneously without having to publish intermediate versions of those modules.

Let's say you have a multi-module Java project with the following structure:

css

Copy code

`my-java-project/ ├── module1/ │   ├── build.gradle │   └── src/ ├── module2/ │   ├── build.gradle │   └── src/ ├── module3/ │   ├── build.gradle │   └── src/ └── settings.gradle`

Here's an example of how you can set up a composite build in `settings.gradle`:

groovy

Copy code

`includeBuild 'module1' includeBuild 'module2' includeBuild 'module3'`

And then, in the `build.gradle` file of your main project (let's call it `my-java-project`), you can include these modules as dependencies:

groovy

Copy code

`dependencies {     implementation project(':module1')     implementation project(':module2')     implementation project(':module3') }`

This way, when you work on `my-java-project`, Gradle will recognize the changes you make in `module1`, `module2`, and `module3`, allowing you to build and test the entire project as if it were a single unit.

Remember that in each submodule's `build.gradle` file, you should declare its dependencies properly, which might include other modules within the same project or external dependencies.

Ensure also that each submodule has a `settings.gradle` file that defines its own module name. For instance:

groovy

Copy code

`rootProject.name = 'module1'`

This ensures that Gradle knows how to reference each submodule within the composite build.

please can you add another module inside module 1

Sure, let's add another module inside `module1`. Here's how the updated directory structure might look:

css

Copy code

`my-java-project/ ├── module1/ │   ├── build.gradle │   ├── settings.gradle │   └── src/ │       └── main/ │           └── java/ ├── module2/ │   ├── build.gradle │   └── src/ ├── module3/ │   ├── build.gradle │   └── src/ └── settings.gradle`

Inside `module1`, we'll add a new module, let's call it `submodule1`:

css

Copy code

`module1/ ├── build.gradle ├── settings.gradle ├── src/ │   └── main/ │       └── java/ └── submodule1/     ├── build.gradle     └── src/`

Now, let's update the `settings.gradle` file of `module1` to include `submodule1`:

groovy

Copy code

`include ':submodule1'`

And in the `build.gradle` of `module1`, you would typically have:

groovy

Copy code

`dependencies {     // Dependencies specific to module1 }`

In the `settings.gradle` of `submodule1`, you should specify its name:

groovy

Copy code

`rootProject.name = 'submodule1'`

And then, in the `build.gradle` of `submodule1`, you might have:

groovy

Copy code

`dependencies {     // Dependencies specific to submodule1 }`

Finally, in the `build.gradle` of your main project (`my-java-project`), you would include both `module1` and `submodule1`:

groovy

Copy code

`dependencies {     implementation project(':module1')     implementation project(':module2')     implementation project(':module3') }`

With this setup, Gradle will treat `submodule1` as part of `module1` in the composite build.
