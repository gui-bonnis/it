In HTTP, idempotent methods are those that can be called multiple times without different outcomes. Here are the idempotent HTTP methods:

1. **GET**: Fetches a resource. Multiple identical GET requests have the same effect as a single request.
2. **PUT**: Replaces a resource. Multiple identical PUT requests will result in the resource being in the same state.
3. **DELETE**: Deletes a resource. Multiple identical DELETE requests will result in the resource being deleted.
4. **HEAD**: Similar to GET but only retrieves the headers. Multiple identical HEAD requests will have the same effect.
5. **OPTIONS**: Used to describe the communication options for the target resource. Multiple identical OPTIONS requests will have the same effect.

Note that **POST** is not idempotent because multiple identical POST requests may have different outcomes (e.g., creating multiple records).
