To configure three VMs using Ansible, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Ansible: Ensure that Ansible is installed on your control machine.
    
2. Inventory Setup: Create an inventory file that lists the details of the three VMs you want to configure. The inventory file typically contains the IP addresses or hostnames of the VMs and any required connection information, such as SSH usernames and passwords.
    
    Example inventory file (inventory.ini):
    
    csharp
    
    Copy code
    
    `[vms] vm1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=myuser ansible_password=mypassword vm2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11 ansible_user=myuser ansible_password=mypassword vm3 ansible_host=192.168.1.12 ansible_user=myuser ansible_password=mypassword`
    
3. Playbook Creation: Create a playbook that defines the desired configuration for the VMs. A playbook is a YAML file that specifies a set of tasks to be executed on the target hosts.
    
    Example playbook (configure_vms.yml):
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `--- - name: Configure VMs   hosts: vms   tasks:     - name: Install package       apt:         name: mypackage         state: present`
    
    The above example playbook installs a package named "mypackage" on the VMs.
    
4. Run the Playbook: Use the `ansible-playbook` command to run the playbook against the VMs.
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini configure_vms.yml`
    
    This command executes the tasks defined in the playbook on the VMs listed in the inventory file.
    

As for Ansible Tower, it provides a web-based interface for managing and running Ansible playbooks. It simplifies the management of Ansible configurations, including inventory, playbooks, and scheduling. Ansible Tower can be used to configure multiple VMs, including the three VMs mentioned in your case. With Ansible Tower, you can create job templates, schedule playbook runs, manage inventories, and view the execution logs and results in a centralized manner.

Using Ansible Tower, you can import the inventory and playbook, create a job template that references them, and then launch the job template to configure the three VMs. Ansible Tower provides additional features like RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), notifications, and a graphical dashboard for monitoring and managing Ansible tasks.

If you are encountering "unreachable" errors when attempting to execute a playbook against a remote VM using Ansible, there are a few possible reasons and solutions to consider:

1. Network Connectivity: Ensure that you have network connectivity between the control machine (where Ansible is running) and the target VM. Verify that you can reach the VM's IP address or hostname from the control machine using tools like `ping` or `ssh`. If there are network restrictions or firewalls in place, you may need to configure them to allow the necessary connections.
    
2. SSH Configuration: Check the SSH configuration on the target VM. Ansible uses SSH to connect to the remote hosts. Ensure that SSH is properly installed and running on the target VM. Verify that you can manually SSH into the VM from the control machine using the same credentials specified in the inventory file.
    
3. SSH User and Credentials: Confirm that the SSH username and password specified in the Ansible inventory file are correct. Ensure that the user specified has the necessary permissions to access and configure the VM.
    
4. SSH Key Authentication: Consider using SSH key authentication instead of passwords. Generate an SSH key pair on the control machine using `ssh-keygen` and add the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the target VM for the SSH user. Update the inventory file to use the SSH key for authentication instead of the password.
    
5. Inventory Configuration: Double-check the inventory file to ensure that the IP address or hostname, SSH username, and password are correctly specified for the target VM. Verify that there are no syntax errors in the inventory file.
    
6. Ansible Configuration: Review the Ansible configuration file (`ansible.cfg`) to ensure that it is correctly set up. Check the `remote_user` and `private_key_file` settings, if applicable, to ensure they match your environment.
    
7. Host Key Verification: If you are connecting to a VM for the first time, you may encounter a "Host key verification failed" error. In such cases, you can disable strict host key checking by setting `host_key_checking = False` in the Ansible configuration file. Note that this should be used with caution, as it reduces the security of SSH connections.
    
8. Debugging and Verbose Output: You can enable verbose output by using the `-vvv` flag with the `ansible-playbook` command. This will provide more detailed information about the connection process and may help identify the cause of the "unreachable" error.
    

By investigating these points and resolving any potential issues, you should be able to establish a successful connection and execute your playbook on the remote VM using Ansible.

Please can you generate an ansible playbook for me that creates a user with password static. This user will be able to connect to another VM using ssh without need to ask for password of check ssh validation

###### ChatGPT said:

Certainly! Here's an example Ansible playbook that creates a user with a static password and sets up passwordless SSH authentication to another VM:

yaml

Copy code

`--- - name: Configure User and Passwordless SSH   hosts: target_vm   become: yes   tasks:     - name: Create User       user:         name: myuser         password: "{{ 'static_password' | password_hash('sha512', 'my_salt') }}"         createhome: yes         shell: /bin/bash      - name: Add SSH Key to Authorized Keys       authorized_key:         user: myuser         state: present         key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"      - name: Disable Password Authentication in SSH       lineinfile:         dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config         regexp: '^#?PasswordAuthentication'         line: 'PasswordAuthentication no'         state: present       notify:         - restart sshd    handlers:     - name: restart sshd       service:         name: sshd         state: restarted`

In the playbook above, make sure to replace `target_vm` with the name or group of your target VM in your inventory file. Also, replace `myuser` with the desired username for the new user.

The playbook performs the following tasks:

1. Creates a user named `myuser` with the specified password. You can replace `'static_password'` with the desired password for the user. The password is hashed using SHA-512 algorithm with a custom salt.
    
2. Adds the SSH public key from the control machine's `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file to the `myuser`'s `authorized_keys` file on the target VM. This allows passwordless SSH authentication for the user.
    
3. Modifies the SSH configuration on the target VM to disable password authentication by modifying the `PasswordAuthentication` setting in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to `no`.
    
4. Finally, it triggers a restart of the SSH service to apply the changes.
    

Ensure that you have SSH access to the target VM with appropriate privileges to perform the user creation and SSH configuration. Adjust the playbook as needed to match your specific requirements.

I didn't mean to remove the password, I just don't want to be asked for password in any moment

###### ChatGPT said:

Apologies for the misunderstanding. If you want to create a user with a static password and configure passwordless SSH login for that user, you can modify the playbook as follows:

yaml

Copy code

`--- - name: Configure User and Passwordless SSH   hosts: target_vm   become: yes   tasks:     - name: Create User       user:         name: myuser         password: "{{ 'static_password' | password_hash('sha512', 'my_salt') }}"         createhome: yes         shell: /bin/bash      - name: Add SSH Key to Authorized Keys       authorized_key:         user: myuser         state: present         key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"      - name: Configure SSH Password Authentication       lineinfile:         dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config         regexp: '^#?PasswordAuthentication'         line: 'PasswordAuthentication yes'         state: present       notify:         - restart sshd      - name: Reload SSH Configuration       service:         name: sshd         state: reloaded    handlers:     - name: restart sshd       service:         name: sshd         state: restarted`

In this updated playbook, the `PasswordAuthentication` setting in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` is modified to `yes`, allowing password authentication. The SSH key is still added to the `authorized_keys` file for passwordless SSH login, but users can also log in using their static password if they prefer.

After making the necessary changes, run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command, specifying the inventory file and playbook name:

bash

Copy code

`ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini configure_user.yml`

Remember to replace `target_vm` with the name or group of your target VM in the inventory file, and `myuser` with the desired username for the new user. Adjust any other parameters as needed.

Certainly! Here's an example Ansible playbook that installs Ansible Tower:

yaml

Copy code

`--- - name: Install Ansible Tower   hosts: tower_server   become: yes   tasks:     - name: Install dependencies       package:         name: ['policycoreutils-python', 'python3-pip']      - name: Install Ansible Tower       pip:         name: ansible-tower-cli         state: latest      - name: Configure Ansible Tower       command: tower-cli config host {{ tower_host }} username {{ tower_username }} password {{ tower_password }}      - name: Install Ansible Tower       command: tower-cli setup      - name: Start Ansible Tower       command: tower-cli service start      - name: Add License File       copy:         src: /path/to/license_file.lic         dest: /etc/tower/license       notify:         - restart ansible-tower    handlers:     - name: restart ansible-tower       command: tower-cli service restart`

Make sure to replace `tower_server` with the name or group of your Ansible Tower server in your inventory file. Additionally, provide the appropriate values for the following variables in your playbook or by passing them as extra variables:

- `tower_host`: The URL or IP address of your Ansible Tower server.
- `tower_username`: The username for authenticating with Ansible Tower.
- `tower_password`: The password for authenticating with Ansible Tower.
- `/path/to/license_file.lic`: The path to your Ansible Tower license file.

The playbook performs the following tasks:

1. Installs the necessary dependencies, such as `policycoreutils-python` and `python3-pip`, on the Ansible Tower server.
    
2. Uses `pip` to install the latest version of the Ansible Tower CLI (`ansible-tower-cli`).
    
3. Configures the Ansible Tower CLI with the provided hostname, username, and password.
    
4. Runs the Ansible Tower setup process to initialize the installation.
    
5. Starts the Ansible Tower service.
    
6. Copies the license file to the appropriate location on the Ansible Tower server.
    
7. Triggers a restart of the Ansible Tower service to apply the license.
    

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and meet the system requirements to install Ansible Tower. Adjust the playbook and variable values as per your specific environment and configuration.
