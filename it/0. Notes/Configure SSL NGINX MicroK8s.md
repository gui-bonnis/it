To configure SSL for NGINX in a MicroK8s Kubernetes cluster, you'll typically use **Ingress** along with a **TLS certificate**. You can generate the TLS certificate using **Cert-Manager** (automating Let's Encrypt) or provide your own self-signed certificate. Below are the steps to set up SSL for NGINX Ingress:

### Prerequisites

1. **MicroK8s installed and running** with NGINX Ingress enabled.
2. A **Kubernetes cluster** (`kubectl` configured for MicroK8s).
3. **Domain name** pointing to your MicroK8s IP address.
4. **Cert-Manager** for automatic SSL certificates (optional).

### Steps to Configure SSL for NGINX

#### 1. Enable NGINX Ingress in MicroK8s

Make sure NGINX is enabled:

bash

Copy code

`microk8s enable ingress`

#### 2. Install Cert-Manager (Optional for Let’s Encrypt)

To automate the SSL certificate process using Let’s Encrypt, install Cert-Manager:

bash

Copy code

`microk8s enable cert-manager`

#### 3. Create a Self-Signed or Let’s Encrypt Certificate

##### Option A: Let’s Encrypt with Cert-Manager

First, create a `ClusterIssuer` for Let’s Encrypt:

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 kind: ClusterIssuer metadata:   name: letsencrypt-prod spec:   acme:     email: your-email@example.com     server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory     privateKeySecretRef:       name: letsencrypt-prod     solvers:     - http01:         ingress:           class: nginx`

Save this to a file called `letsencrypt-issuer.yaml` and apply it:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f letsencrypt-issuer.yaml`

##### Option B: Self-Signed Certificate

If you don't want to use Let's Encrypt, generate a self-signed certificate:

bash

Copy code

`openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=your-domain.com/O=your-organization"`

Create a Kubernetes secret with the certificate:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl create secret tls your-tls-secret --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key`

#### 4. Configure the Ingress Resource for SSL

Now, create an Ingress resource that uses the SSL certificate. For Let’s Encrypt, the certificate will be automatically issued. For self-signed certificates, you’ll use the secret created earlier.

Example Ingress resource:

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: example-ingress   namespace: default   annotations:     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /     cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"  # For Let's Encrypt spec:   tls:   - hosts:     - your-domain.com     secretName: your-tls-secret  # Secret name for Let's Encrypt or self-signed   rules:   - host: your-domain.com     http:       paths:       - path: /         pathType: Prefix         backend:           service:             name: your-service             port:               number: 80`

Save the Ingress file as `ingress.yaml` and apply it:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml`

#### 5. Verify SSL Setup

Once your Ingress and certificate are set up, you can verify it:

1. Run `kubectl get ingress` to confirm the Ingress has the correct IP.
2. Access `https://your-domain.com` in your browser to check if the certificate is properly configured.

### Troubleshooting

- **DNS Issues**: Ensure your domain is correctly pointing to your MicroK8s IP address.
- **Certificate not issued**: If using Let's Encrypt, make sure your Ingress controller can access the Let's Encrypt ACME server (no firewall issues).
- **Self-signed certificate warnings**: Browsers will show warnings for self-signed certificates, which is expected.

This configuration ensures that your NGINX Ingress has SSL support with Kubernetes on MicroK8s.

How can I check if the certificate is valid?

You can check if the SSL certificate is valid by using several methods. Here are a few common ways to verify the certificate:

### 1. **Using OpenSSL Command-Line Tool**

You can use the `openssl` command to check the validity of the SSL certificate directly from the terminal.

bash

Copy code

`openssl s_client -connect your-domain.com:443`

This command initiates an SSL/TLS connection to your domain on port 443 (the HTTPS port). After running it, you’ll see a lot of output. Look for details about the certificate like:

- **Certificate Chain**
- **Validity Dates** (`Not Before` and `Not After`)
- **Issuer** (e.g., Let’s Encrypt or self-signed)
- **Subject** (your domain name)

For example:

yaml

Copy code

`Certificate chain  0 s:/CN=your-domain.com    i:/C=US/O=Let's Encrypt/CN=R3 --- Server certificate -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ... -----END CERTIFICATE----- subject=/CN=your-domain.com issuer=/C=US/O=Let's Encrypt/CN=R3 --- Validity     Not Before: Sep 28 00:00:00 2023 GMT     Not After : Dec 27 23:59:59 2023 GMT`

If the connection completes successfully and you see the `Server certificate` section with the valid dates, your certificate is valid.

### 2. **Using a Web Browser**

1. **Visit your website**: Open a browser and go to `https://your-domain.com`.
2. **Click the lock icon**: In most browsers, a padlock icon appears to the left of the URL in the address bar.
3. **View certificate details**:
    - In Chrome/Firefox: Click the padlock icon, then click "Certificate" or "View Certificate".
    - Check the validity period, issuer, and if the browser trusts the certificate.

If there’s a problem (e.g., the certificate is expired or invalid), most modern browsers will show a warning page.

### 3. **Using Online SSL Tools**

You can use third-party websites to verify the certificate. Some useful tools include:

- **SSL Labs**: SSL Labs Server Test is one of the most comprehensive tools to check the SSL configuration.
- **SSL Checker**: SSL Checker is a quick tool to check if your certificate is installed correctly.

### 4. **Using `kubectl` to Check the Secret**

If you deployed the SSL certificate using Kubernetes secrets (either self-signed or Let's Encrypt), you can verify the certificate details with the following commands.

#### Check TLS Secret in Kubernetes:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get secret your-tls-secret -o yaml`

This will display the secret in base64 encoded format. You can decode it and check the certificate.

#### Decode and View the Certificate:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get secret your-tls-secret -o jsonpath="{.data['tls\.crt']}" | base64 --decode | openssl x509 -noout -text`

This will output the certificate details such as issuer, validity, and subject.

### 5. **Using `curl` to Verify Certificate**

You can also use the `curl` command to check SSL/TLS details:

bash

Copy code

`curl -v https://your-domain.com --cacert /path/to/your/certificate.crt`

Look for certificate validation information in the output.

If everything is correct, you’ll see a `200 OK` response and no certificate warnings. If the certificate is invalid, you’ll see error messages related to SSL.

By following these methods, you can ensure your SSL certificate is properly installed, valid, and trusted.
