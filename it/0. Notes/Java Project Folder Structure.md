How can I create a java project, more specific a Folder structure that will be versioned. That contains all other projects and tools related to CNCF and 12 Factory, containers, IaC, kubernetes manifest and so on

To create a Java project with a folder structure that supports versioning and adheres to CNCF and 12-Factor principles, including containers, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Kubernetes manifests, you can organize your project as follows:

### Root Structure:

bash

Copy code

`/<project-root> │ ├── /apps                     # Contains multiple apps (Java microservices, etc.) │   ├── /app1                  # One Java microservice │   └── /app2                  # Another Java microservice │ ├── /containers                # Docker images, container-related files │   ├── /app1                  # Dockerfile, docker-compose for app1 │   └── /app2                  # Dockerfile, docker-compose for app2 │ ├── /iac                       # Infrastructure as Code (IaC) files │   ├── /terraform             # Terraform scripts │   └── /ansible               # Ansible playbooks │ ├── /kubernetes                # Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts │   ├── /app1                  # Helm chart or k8s manifest for app1 │   ├── /app2                  # Helm chart or k8s manifest for app2 │   └── /common                # Common Kubernetes resources like ingress, secrets │ ├── /scripts                   # Automation and build scripts │   └── deploy.sh              # Deployment script for CI/CD │ ├── /ci-cd                     # CI/CD configurations │   └── Jenkinsfile            # Jenkins pipelines or other CI/CD tools │ ├── /docs                      # Documentation for the project │   └── README.md              # Overview of the entire project │ ├── /config                    # Configuration for different environments (12-Factor) │   ├── /dev                   # Development environment config │   ├── /staging               # Staging environment config │   └── /prod                  # Production environment config │ └── /libs                      # Shared libraries between projects`

### Detailed Breakdown:

- **/apps**: Each subfolder (app1, app2, etc.) is a separate Java microservice. These follow the 12-Factor principle of "Codebase" and are independently deployable.
- **/containers**: Contains Docker-related files for each application. You can also include a `docker-compose.yml` if you're orchestrating locally.
- **/iac**: Stores IaC scripts, such as Terraform for cloud provisioning or Ansible for configuration management, ensuring reproducible infrastructure setups.
- **/kubernetes**: Manages Kubernetes manifests, including Helm charts, for deploying your apps to a Kubernetes cluster. You can also include `Ingress` and `ConfigMap` for shared resources.
- **/scripts**: Automate deployment and other repetitive tasks. Include any bash or Python scripts needed for automation.
- **/ci-cd**: Houses your CI/CD pipeline configuration. Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions scripts can be stored here.
- **/config**: Store environment-specific configurations, following the 12-Factor principle of separating configuration from code.
- **/libs**: Shared libraries for reuse across your microservices.

This structure is scalable and modular, making it easy to manage and version everything in a single repository. You can store this in a Git repository and utilize branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow) for version control.
