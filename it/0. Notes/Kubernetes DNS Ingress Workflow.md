Please can you explain to me how DNS (Metallb) ExternalDNS (CoreDNS) and Ingress work together?

###### ChatGPT said:

In a Kubernetes setup, DNS, MetalLB, ExternalDNS, and Ingress work together to route and manage traffic to services running inside the cluster. Here's how each component plays a role:

### 1. **DNS (CoreDNS)**:

- **CoreDNS** is the default DNS service in Kubernetes clusters. It handles internal DNS resolution for services and pods, allowing them to communicate with each other using service names instead of IPs.
- For example, if you have a service named `my-app` in the namespace `default`, CoreDNS ensures that when a pod tries to reach `my-app.default.svc.cluster.local`, it resolves the name to the correct service IP.

### 2. **MetalLB**:

- **MetalLB** is a load-balancer implementation for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters (like MicroK8s), which typically don't have cloud provider-based load balancing. MetalLB allows you to assign external IP addresses to services that are exposed outside the cluster.
- When a service of type `LoadBalancer` is created, MetalLB assigns an IP address (from a predefined pool of IPs) and forwards traffic to the service. This allows external clients to access the service using that IP.
- MetalLB doesn't handle DNS directly but works with an Ingress controller or ExternalDNS to make services accessible externally.

### 3. **ExternalDNS**:

- **ExternalDNS** automatically manages DNS records for Kubernetes resources like Ingress and services. It integrates with external DNS providers (e.g., Route53, Cloudflare) to create and manage public DNS entries.
- When you deploy a service or an Ingress resource, ExternalDNS creates DNS entries that map domain names to the external IPs (provided by MetalLB or another LoadBalancer).
- For example, if you deploy an Ingress for `my-app` with the domain `my-app.example.com`, ExternalDNS will automatically create a DNS record that points `my-app.example.com` to the external IP assigned by MetalLB.

### 4. **Ingress**:

- **Ingress** is a Kubernetes resource that manages external access to services, typically via HTTP or HTTPS. It allows you to define rules to route traffic based on hostnames and paths to different services within the cluster.
- An **Ingress controller** (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) implements the Ingress resource and handles routing the external traffic to the correct services within the cluster.
- Ingress works with a LoadBalancer (like MetalLB) to expose a single external IP address and route traffic to multiple services based on rules (e.g., paths or domain names).

### How They Work Together:

1. **CoreDNS** handles internal DNS resolution for pods and services, making communication between them easier within the cluster.
    
2. **MetalLB** assigns an external IP to services of type `LoadBalancer`. It forwards traffic from this external IP to the corresponding service inside the cluster.
    
3. **ExternalDNS** ensures that DNS records are created for external-facing services and Ingress resources, so when users try to access `my-app.example.com`, it resolves to the external IP managed by MetalLB.
    
4. **Ingress** acts as the entry point for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, using the external IP provided by MetalLB. It routes traffic based on domain names and paths to different services in the cluster.
    

### Example Workflow:

1. You deploy a service (`my-app`) with an Ingress rule for `my-app.example.com`.
2. MetalLB assigns an external IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) to the Ingress controller.
3. ExternalDNS creates a DNS entry, mapping `my-app.example.com` to `192.168.1.100`.
4. When a user accesses `my-app.example.com`, the DNS lookup resolves the domain to `192.168.1.100`.
5. Traffic arrives at the Ingress controller, which routes the request to the correct service (`my-app`) based on the Ingress rules.

Memory updated

Great! Let's configure each component step by step for your local MicroK8s setup, with the goal of deploying Gitea accessible at `gitea.local.dev` using your external IP `192.168.15.12`.

### 1. **Install and Configure MetalLB**:

MetalLB will provide an external IP for your Ingress, making Gitea accessible from outside the cluster.

#### Steps:

1. **Install MetalLB in MicroK8s**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable metallb`
    
2. **Configure IP Address Pool**: Define a range of IPs that MetalLB can use. Since your external IP is `192.168.15.12`, you can assign a range that fits your network.
    
    Create a `metallb-config.yaml`:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata:   namespace: metallb-system   name: config data:   config: |     address-pools:     - name: default       protocol: layer2       addresses:       - 192.168.15.12-192.168.15.20`
    
    Apply the configuration:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl apply -f metallb-config.yaml`
    

### 2. **Set Up Ingress Controller**:

The Ingress controller will route traffic from `gitea.local.dev` to the Gitea service inside your cluster.

#### Steps:

1. **Enable NGINX Ingress Controller**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable ingress`
    
2. **Create Ingress Resource for Gitea**: Once Gitea is deployed, create an Ingress rule for `gitea.local.dev`:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: gitea-ingress   namespace: gitea spec:   rules:   - host: gitea.local.dev     http:       paths:       - path: /         pathType: Prefix         backend:           service:             name: gitea-service             port:               number: 3000`
    
    Apply the Ingress resource:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl apply -f gitea-ingress.yaml`
    

### 3. **Install ExternalDNS**:

ExternalDNS will manage the DNS records automatically so that `gitea.local.dev` resolves to the external IP provided by MetalLB.

#### Steps:

1. **Install ExternalDNS**: ExternalDNS will be responsible for automatically creating DNS records.
    
    Install ExternalDNS (assuming you're using CoreDNS for internal DNS resolution):
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install external-dns bitnami/external-dns \     --set provider=coredns \     --set sources={ingress} \     --set policy=sync \     --set txtOwnerId=local-cluster \     --set coredns.zone=local.dev.`
    
2. **Configure CoreDNS for `local.dev`**: Update CoreDNS to manage the `local.dev` domain. Edit the CoreDNS ConfigMap:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl edit configmap coredns -n kube-system`
    
    Add the following block to handle `local.dev`:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `local.dev:53 {     errors     cache 30     forward . 8.8.8.8 }`
    
3. **Apply Changes**: Ensure everything is applied correctly by checking the status of MetalLB, Ingress, and ExternalDNS services:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get all -n metallb-system kubectl get all -n ingress kubectl get all -n external-dns`
    

### 4. **Deploy Gitea**:

Now that DNS, MetalLB, and Ingress are configured, deploy Gitea.

#### Steps:

1. **Create Gitea Deployment**: You can create a simple Gitea deployment with the following YAML file:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: gitea   namespace: gitea spec:   replicas: 1   selector:     matchLabels:       app: gitea   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: gitea     spec:       containers:       - name: gitea         image: gitea/gitea:1.16.0         ports:         - containerPort: 3000`
    
    Apply the deployment:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl apply -f gitea-deployment.yaml`
    
2. **Create Gitea Service**: Define a service to expose Gitea within the cluster:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: gitea-service   namespace: gitea spec:   selector:     app: gitea   ports:     - protocol: TCP       port: 3000       targetPort: 3000`
    
    Apply the service:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl apply -f gitea-service.yaml`
    

### 5. **Test Your Setup**:

Once everything is up, verify the DNS record resolves to the external IP (`192.168.15.12`) and Gitea is accessible:

1. **Check DNS Resolution**: On your local machine, run:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `nslookup gitea.local.dev`
    
    It should resolve to `192.168.15.12`.
    
2. **Access Gitea**: Open `http://gitea.local.dev` in your browser, and you should see the Gitea login page.
    

This should fully integrate MetalLB, CoreDNS, ExternalDNS, and Ingress to expose your Gitea application on `gitea.local.dev`. Let me know if you'd like to dive into any specific part further!

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

After editing the CoreDNS ConfigMap, the final version should include the necessary configuration to handle DNS requests for your custom `local.dev` domain. Below is how the `coredns` ConfigMap might look after adding the `local.dev` block:

### Final Version of CoreDNS ConfigMap

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata:   name: coredns   namespace: kube-system data:   Corefile: |     .:53 {         errors         health         ready         kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {            pods insecure            fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa            ttl 30         }         prometheus :9153         forward . /etc/resolv.conf         cache 30         loop         reload         loadbalance     }     local.dev:53 {         errors         cache 30         forward . 8.8.8.8  # This forwards to Google's public DNS for non-cluster queries     }`

### Explanation:

- **`. :53` block**: This handles internal DNS resolution for Kubernetes services and pods using `cluster.local` domain.
- **`local.dev:53` block**: This block is added for handling requests to the `local.dev` domain. It specifies:
    - `errors`: To log any DNS-related errors.
    - `cache 30`: Caches DNS responses for 30 seconds to improve performance.
    - `forward . 8.8.8.8`: This forwards any DNS queries not resolvable by CoreDNS (such as external domains) to Google's public DNS server (or any DNS server you prefer).

This configuration ensures that any DNS requests for `local.dev` are handled by CoreDNS, while other queries are forwarded to the external DNS (Google's 8.8.8.8 in this case).

### Apply the Changes:

After editing the ConfigMap, apply the changes by reloading CoreDNS:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl rollout restart deployment coredns -n kube-system`

This will restart the CoreDNS pods, applying the updated configuration.

##### You said:

kubectl get all -n external-dns No resources found in external-dns namespace.

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

If you see "No resources found in external-dns namespace" when running `kubectl get all -n external-dns`, it likely means that the ExternalDNS service was not installed correctly or wasn't deployed to the `external-dns` namespace.

Let’s walk through the steps to ensure ExternalDNS is properly installed and running.

### Steps to Install ExternalDNS in MicroK8s

1. **Create the Namespace for ExternalDNS**: ExternalDNS should run in its own namespace (e.g., `external-dns`). If the namespace does not exist, create it:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl create namespace external-dns`
    
2. **Install ExternalDNS**: You can use Helm to install ExternalDNS into your cluster. If Helm is not installed, first install it:
    
    - To install Helm:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `snap install helm --classic`
        
    - Add the Bitnami Helm repository if you haven't done so:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
        
    - Install ExternalDNS with CoreDNS support:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `helm install external-dns bitnami/external-dns \     --namespace external-dns \     --set provider=coredns \     --set sources={ingress} \     --set policy=sync \     --set txtOwnerId=local-cluster \     --set coredns.zone=local.dev.`
        
    
    This Helm command will:
    
    - Install ExternalDNS in the `external-dns` namespace.
    - Configure ExternalDNS to manage DNS records for `local.dev` via CoreDNS.
    - Sync DNS records based on Kubernetes Ingress resources.
3. **Verify the Installation**: Once the Helm chart is installed, verify that the ExternalDNS pods are running:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get all -n external-dns`
    
    You should see the ExternalDNS deployment and pod running.
    
4. **Check the Logs**: If the ExternalDNS pod is running, you can check its logs to ensure it is managing DNS records correctly:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl logs -n external-dns deployment/external-dns`
    
    The logs should show ExternalDNS processing DNS records for Ingress resources.
    

### Troubleshooting:

- **No Resources Found**: If you still see no resources, ensure that Helm installed ExternalDNS successfully by checking Helm releases:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm list -n external-dns`
    
- **DNS Configuration**: Ensure that `local.dev` is properly configured in CoreDNS, and that the Ingress resources have the correct DNS settings.

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The `NXDOMAIN` error indicates that the DNS resolution for `gitea.local.dev` is failing, meaning that CoreDNS is not yet correctly configured to handle the `local.dev` domain. Let's troubleshoot and fix this issue step by step.

### Steps to Resolve the DNS Issue

#### 1. **Check CoreDNS Configuration**

Ensure that the `local.dev` block was properly added to the CoreDNS ConfigMap.

1. **Check CoreDNS ConfigMap**: Verify that the `local.dev` block was added to the CoreDNS ConfigMap and applied correctly.
    
    Run:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get configmap coredns -n kube-system -o yaml`
    
    Ensure the `local.dev:53` block is correctly added under the `Corefile` section.
    
    Example:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata:   name: coredns   namespace: kube-system data:   Corefile: |     .:53 {         errors         health         kubernetes cluster.local in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa {             pods insecure             fallthrough in-addr.arpa ip6.arpa             ttl 30         }         forward . /etc/resolv.conf         cache 30     }     local.dev:53 {         errors         cache 30         forward . 8.8.8.8     }`
    
2. **Restart CoreDNS**: If the ConfigMap is correct, restart the CoreDNS pods to ensure the configuration is applied:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl rollout restart deployment coredns -n kube-system`
    

#### 2. **Check the Ingress Setup**

Make sure that your Gitea Ingress is properly configured with the correct hostname (`gitea.local.dev`).

1. **Verify Ingress Resource**: Check the Ingress resource to ensure the `host` is set to `gitea.local.dev`.
    
    Run:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get ingress gitea-ingress -n gitea -o yaml`
    
    Ensure the `host` field is properly set in the YAML:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `rules: - host: gitea.local.dev   http:     paths:     - path: /       pathType: Prefix       backend:         service:           name: gitea-service           port:             number: 3000`
    
2. **Check Ingress Controller**: Ensure that the NGINX Ingress controller is running.
    
    Run:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get pods -n ingress`
    
    If you don’t see the Ingress controller pods, enable it again:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable ingress`
    

#### 3. **Verify MetalLB and External IP**

Ensure that MetalLB has assigned an external IP for the Gitea service, which the DNS will point to.

1. **Check MetalLB IP Assignment**: Check if the Gitea service is assigned an external IP by MetalLB:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get svc -n gitea`
    
    The output should show the external IP assigned to your Gitea service (e.g., `192.168.15.12`).
    

#### 4. **Check ExternalDNS**

Verify that ExternalDNS is properly managing the DNS records for `gitea.local.dev`.

1. **Check ExternalDNS Logs**: Check the logs of the ExternalDNS deployment to ensure that it’s processing Ingress resources:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl logs -n external-dns deployment/external-dns`
    
    The logs should indicate if DNS records are being created and updated.
    
2. **Verify DNS Records**: ExternalDNS should be updating the DNS records for `gitea.local.dev`. You can manually check the DNS configuration.
    

#### 5. **Test DNS Resolution Locally**

If everything seems configured correctly in Kubernetes, test DNS resolution again from your local machine.

- **Modify `/etc/hosts` for Testing** (Optional): If DNS resolution still fails, you can temporarily add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file to bypass DNS issues and test Gitea:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
    
    Add:
    
    plaintext
    
    Copy code
    
    `192.168.15.12 gitea.local.dev`
    
    Then test again by visiting `http://gitea.local.dev` in your browser.
    

### Conclusion

By verifying the CoreDNS configuration, Ingress setup, and MetalLB’s external IP, you should be able to resolve the `NXDOMAIN` error. Let me know if any of these steps reveal issues or if you need further assistance!

The error message you're seeing:

go

Copy code

`rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = latest balancer error: last connection error: connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp: lookup etcd-extdns on 10.152.183.10:53: no such host"`

indicates that ExternalDNS is attempting to connect to an `etcd` service called `etcd-extdns`, but it cannot resolve this hostname. The `etcd` service appears to be missing or misconfigured.

### Possible Causes

1. **Incorrect ExternalDNS Configuration**: The ExternalDNS setup might be referencing an `etcd` service that doesn't exist in your cluster or is misconfigured.
2. **Misconfigured Service Discovery**: The hostname `etcd-extdns` might be incorrect or not registered in CoreDNS.
3. **etcd not Installed or Misconfigured**: If you're running a custom `etcd` cluster for ExternalDNS, it may not be properly set up.

### Steps to Troubleshoot and Fix

#### 1. **Check ExternalDNS Configuration**

First, check the configuration for ExternalDNS to ensure it isn't unnecessarily trying to use `etcd`. By default, ExternalDNS does not require `etcd`, so this could be a misconfiguration.

1. **Check Deployment Configuration**: Run the following command to inspect the ExternalDNS deployment configuration:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get deployment external-dns -n external-dns -o yaml`
    
2. **Look for `etcd` References**: Check if there are any references to `etcd-extdns` or `etcd` in the `args` or `env` fields of the deployment. If you find such references and you're not using an `etcd` cluster, remove them.
    
    You should only need ExternalDNS to connect to CoreDNS (in your case). If you see any arguments that point to an `etcd` service, such as `--etcd-endpoints` or similar, you can remove them.
    
    Example configuration (without `etcd`):
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `args:   - --source=ingress   - --provider=coredns   - --policy=sync   - --registry=txt   - --txt-owner-id=my-cluster   - --coredns-zone=local.dev.`
    
3. **Update the Deployment**: If you find unnecessary `etcd` configurations, update the deployment by either editing it directly or updating the Helm chart values.
    
    To update via `kubectl`:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl edit deployment external-dns -n external-dns`
    

#### 2. **Restart ExternalDNS**

After updating the configuration, restart the ExternalDNS deployment to apply changes:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl rollout restart deployment external-dns -n external-dns`

#### 3. **Ensure Correct DNS Resolution**

Make sure CoreDNS is properly configured and running in the `kube-system` namespace.

1. **Check CoreDNS Pods**: Ensure that the CoreDNS pods are running and healthy:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns`
    
2. **Test DNS Resolution for ExternalDNS**: If CoreDNS is working correctly, run a DNS lookup test within the cluster to ensure `local.dev` can be resolved:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl run -i --tty dns-test --image=busybox --restart=Never -- nslookup gitea.local.dev`
    
    This will verify if the DNS resolution is working inside the cluster.
    

#### 4. **Check ExternalDNS Logs Again**

After making these changes, recheck the logs of ExternalDNS to see if it is now able to function correctly:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl logs -n external-dns deployment/external-dns`

If ExternalDNS is properly configured, it should no longer be trying to reach `etcd` and should begin updating DNS records for `local.dev`.

### Summary

The issue stems from ExternalDNS attempting to connect to an `etcd` service that it doesn’t need for your use case. Adjust the ExternalDNS configuration to remove any references to `etcd`, and ensure that it's correctly pointing to CoreDNS to manage the `local.dev` zone.
