To configure Gitea to serve repositories over HTTPS, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:

1. **Domain name**: You will need a domain or IP address for your Gitea instance.
2. **SSL Certificate**: Use a trusted certificate, such as from Let's Encrypt, or a self-signed certificate for development purposes.

### Steps:

#### 1. **Install Gitea** (if not done already)

Follow the Gitea installation guide to install Gitea on your server or local machine.

#### 2. **Generate SSL Certificates**

You need SSL certificates for HTTPS. You can either use:

- **Let's Encrypt** (recommended for production):
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo apt install certbot sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com`
    
    Certificates will be stored in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/`.
    
- **Self-signed certificate** (for testing purposes):
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 \ -out /etc/ssl/certs/gitea.crt -keyout /etc/ssl/private/gitea.key`
    

#### 3. **Configure Gitea for HTTPS**

Modify Gitea's configuration file (`/etc/gitea/app.ini`) to enable HTTPS.

1. **Open Gitea's config file**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo nano /etc/gitea/app.ini`
    
2. **Locate the `[server]` section** and modify the following:
    
    ini
    
    Copy code
    
    `[server] PROTOCOL = https DOMAIN = yourdomain.com HTTP_PORT = 443 CERT_FILE = /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem  # or /etc/ssl/certs/gitea.crt for self-signed KEY_FILE = /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem     # or /etc/ssl/private/gitea.key for self-signed`
    
    If you're using Let's Encrypt, adjust `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` to point to your Let's Encrypt certificates.
    
3. **Optional: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS** You can redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS by adding the following:
    
    ini
    
    Copy code
    
    `[server] REDIRECT_OTHER_PORT = true PORT_TO_REDIRECT = 80`
    
4. **Save the configuration** and exit.
    

#### 4. **Open Port 443 in the Firewall**

Ensure your firewall allows HTTPS traffic.

For **UFW** (Ubuntu's default firewall):

bash

Copy code

`sudo ufw allow 443/tcp`

#### 5. **Restart Gitea**

Restart Gitea for the changes to take effect:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl restart gitea`

#### 6. **Access Gitea via HTTPS**

You can now access your Gitea instance using `https://yourdomain.com`.

### Additional Notes:

- If you're using a reverse proxy like **NGINX** or **Traefik**, you can terminate SSL there and configure Gitea to listen on HTTP behind the proxy.

how can I configure gitea to have ssh repositories

To configure Gitea to serve repositories over SSH, you need to ensure that Gitea is properly set up to allow SSH access. Here's how to do it:

### Steps to Configure Gitea for SSH Access:

#### 1. **Install Gitea** (if not done already)

Follow the Gitea installation guide to install Gitea on your server or machine.

#### 2. **Ensure SSH is Enabled on Your Server**

Make sure your server has SSH enabled, as Gitea will rely on it to provide SSH-based access to repositories.

- **To check if SSH is running**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo systemctl status ssh`
    
    If it's not running, start it:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo systemctl start ssh`
    

#### 3. **Configure Gitea for SSH**

1. **Open Gitea's configuration file**: Gitea’s configuration is stored in the `app.ini` file. The location may vary depending on how you installed Gitea, but it's typically found at:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `/etc/gitea/app.ini`
    
2. **Modify the `[server]` section**: You need to tell Gitea to enable SSH support.
    
    Open the configuration file for editing:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo nano /etc/gitea/app.ini`
    
    In the `[server]` section, add or update the following settings:
    
    ini
    
    Copy code
    
    `[server] PROTOCOL = http DOMAIN = yourdomain.com HTTP_PORT = 3000 ROOT_URL = http://yourdomain.com/  SSH_DOMAIN = yourdomain.com START_SSH_SERVER = true SSH_PORT = 22          # Adjust this if you're running SSH on a custom port LFS_START_SERVER = true  # Optional: enable LFS support for SSH`
    
    - **PROTOCOL**: Leave it as `http` since Gitea will serve web traffic over HTTP, while SSH handles repository interactions.
    - **SSH_DOMAIN**: Set this to your server’s domain or IP address.
    - **SSH_PORT**: Set this to the port SSH is listening on. Typically, this is `22`, but it may vary.
    - **START_SSH_SERVER**: Set this to `true` if you want Gitea to manage its own SSH server. Otherwise, Gitea will rely on the system’s SSH server.
    - **LFS_START_SERVER**: This enables Git Large File Storage (LFS) support over SSH.
3. **Save and exit** the file.
    

#### 4. **Ensure the SSH Keys Directory is Correct**

Gitea stores user SSH keys for repository access in the `~/.ssh` directory of the Gitea user (usually the `git` user).

Check that Gitea has write access to the SSH directory:

bash

Copy code

`sudo chown -R git:git /home/git/.ssh sudo chmod 700 /home/git/.ssh`

#### 5. **Generate SSH Keys for the Gitea Server**

If you're running Gitea under a user like `git`, ensure that user has an SSH key:

bash

Copy code

`sudo -u git ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "gitea@example.com"`

This key will be used for internal SSH operations (if necessary).

#### 6. **Set Up User SSH Keys**

Each user of the Gitea instance will need to set up their own SSH key for repository access.

1. **Generate an SSH key** on the user’s machine (if they don’t already have one):
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`
    
2. **Add the public SSH key to the Gitea user profile**:
    
    - Log in to Gitea.
    - Go to `Settings > SSH / GPG Keys`.
    - Add the generated public SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

#### 7. **Open SSH Port in Firewall**

Ensure your firewall allows traffic on the SSH port (default 22). For **UFW** (on Ubuntu):

bash

Copy code

`sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`

If you are using a custom SSH port, open that instead.

#### 8. **Restart Gitea**

Restart Gitea to apply the changes:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl restart gitea`

#### 9. **Access Repositories via SSH**

Once Gitea is configured, users can clone repositories using SSH like so:

bash

Copy code

`git clone git@yourdomain.com:username/repo.git`

### Additional Notes:

- If you are using a custom SSH port (e.g., 2222), users should clone repositories like this:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone ssh://git@yourdomain.com:2222/username/repo.git`
    
- Make sure that users have their SSH keys properly added to their Gitea profiles, otherwise they will get authentication errors when trying to push/pull over SSH.
    

This setup will allow users to securely access Gitea repositories over SSH.
