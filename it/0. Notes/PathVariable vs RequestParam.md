In Java Spring Boot, both `@PathVariable` and `@RequestParam` are used to extract data from a URL in a web application, but they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

1. `@PathVariable`:
    
    - `@PathVariable` is used to extract values from the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) template, particularly from the path of the URL.
    - It is typically used for capturing values that are part of the URL's path, such as IDs, names, or other dynamic segments.
    - The values extracted using `@PathVariable` are part of the URL's structure and are included in the path itself.
    - For example, if you have a URL like `/products/{productId}`, you can use `@PathVariable` to extract the `productId` from the URL path.
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `@GetMapping("/products/{productId}") public ResponseEntity<Product> getProductById(@PathVariable Long productId) {     // Code to retrieve product by ID }`
    
2. `@RequestParam`:
    
    - `@RequestParam` is used to extract values from the query parameters of a URL. Query parameters are the key-value pairs that come after the "?" in a URL.
    - It is typically used for capturing optional or query-based parameters that are not part of the URL path.
    - Query parameters are often used for filtering, sorting, or specifying additional information in a request.
    - For example, if you have a URL like `/products?category=electronics`, you can use `@RequestParam` to extract the `category` parameter.
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `@GetMapping("/products") public ResponseEntity<List<Product>> getProductsByCategory(@RequestParam String category) {     // Code to retrieve products by category }`
    

In summary, the main difference between `@PathVariable` and `@RequestParam` in Java Spring Boot is in the source of the data they extract and their use cases:

- `@PathVariable` extracts data from the URL path itself, typically used for essential parameters in the URL structure.
- `@RequestParam` extracts data from the query parameters in the URL, typically used for optional or query-based parameters.

You can use them in combination to handle both path-based and query parameter-based data in your Spring Boot controllers.
