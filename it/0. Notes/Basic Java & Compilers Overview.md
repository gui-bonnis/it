Of course! I'd be happy to help you review some basic Java and compiler questions for your interview. Here are some common topics and questions you might encounter:

### Basic Java Questions

1. **What are the main features of Java?**
    
    - Object-Oriented
    - Platform Independent
    - Simple
    - Secure
    - Robust
    - Multithreaded
    - Distributed
    - Dynamic
2. **What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?**
    
    - **JDK (Java Development Kit):** A full-featured software development kit for Java, including JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools.
    - **JRE (Java Runtime Environment):** Provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.
    - **JVM (Java Virtual Machine):** An abstract machine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode.
3. **Explain the concept of object-oriented programming and its principles.**
    
    - **Encapsulation:** Bundling the data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit (class).
    - **Inheritance:** Mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class.
    - **Polymorphism:** Ability of a variable, function, or object to take multiple forms.
    - **Abstraction:** Hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.
4. **What are the main differences between interfaces and abstract classes in Java?**
    
    - **Abstract Class:** Can have abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation). A class can extend only one abstract class.
    - **Interface:** Can only have abstract methods (Java 8 onwards, default and static methods are allowed). A class can implement multiple interfaces.
5. **What is the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java?**
    
    - `==` checks for reference equality (whether two references point to the same object).
    - `equals()` checks for value equality (whether two objects have the same value).
6. **What is a constructor in Java?**
    
    - A special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the new object. A constructor has the same name as the class and does not have a return type.

### Compiler Questions

1. **What is a compiler?**
    
    - A compiler is a software that translates high-level source code written in one programming language into machine code, bytecode, or another programming language. It performs various stages like lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
2. **Explain the stages of compilation.**
    
    - **Lexical Analysis:** Converts the source code into tokens.
    - **Syntax Analysis:** Parses the tokens to ensure the code follows the correct syntax.
    - **Semantic Analysis:** Checks for semantic errors and ensures the code makes sense.
    - **Intermediate Code Generation:** Generates an intermediate code that is easier to translate into machine code.
    - **Optimization:** Improves the intermediate code to make it more efficient.
    - **Code Generation:** Converts the optimized intermediate code into machine code.
    - **Code Linking:** Combines different code modules into a single executable program.
3. **What is Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in Java?**
    
    - JIT compilation is a feature of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that improves the performance of Java applications by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime. This allows the Java application to run faster than it would with interpretation alone.
4. **What is garbage collection in Java?**
    
    - Garbage collection is the process of automatically reclaiming memory by deleting objects that are no longer reachable in the program. The JVM performs garbage collection to free up memory and avoid memory leaks.
5. **What are the different types of garbage collectors in Java?**
    
    - **Serial Garbage Collector:** Uses a single thread for garbage collection.
    - **Parallel Garbage Collector:** Uses multiple threads for garbage collection.
    - **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) Garbage Collector:** Performs garbage collection concurrently with the execution of the program.
    - **G1 (Garbage-First) Garbage Collector:** Divides the heap into regions and collects the regions with the least amount of live data first.

### Practice Questions

1. Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of inheritance.
2. Explain the process of exception handling in Java with an example.
3. What are the different types of memory areas allocated by the JVM?
4. How does the `final` keyword differ when applied to a class, method, and variable?
5. Write a Java program to implement a simple multithreading example.

Can you help me to review some Thread and Thread safe questions for Java interview

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Sure, I'd be happy to help you review some Java thread and thread-safety questions for your interview. Here are some common questions and answers:

### Thread and Concurrency Questions

1. **What is a thread in Java?**
    
    - A thread is a lightweight process and the smallest unit of processing. In Java, threads can be created by implementing the `Runnable` interface or extending the `Thread` class.
2. **How do you create a thread in Java?**
    
    - **By extending the `Thread` class:**
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `class MyThread extends Thread {     public void run() {         System.out.println("Thread is running.");     } }  public class TestThread {     public static void main(String[] args) {         MyThread t1 = new MyThread();         t1.start();     } }`
        
    - **By implementing the `Runnable` interface:**
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `class MyRunnable implements Runnable {     public void run() {         System.out.println("Thread is running.");     } }  public class TestThread {     public static void main(String[] args) {         Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());         t1.start();     } }`
        
3. **What is the difference between `start()` and `run()` methods in Java threads?**
    
    - `start()`: Creates a new thread and calls the `run()` method of the `Runnable` object in a new thread.
    - `run()`: A normal method that can be called directly like any other method. If called directly, no new thread is created and the code will run in the current thread.
4. **What is thread safety and why is it important?**
    
    - Thread safety ensures that shared data is accessed and modified by multiple threads without causing data inconsistency or corruption. It is important because it prevents race conditions, deadlocks, and other concurrency issues.
5. **How can you achieve thread safety in Java?**
    
    - **Synchronization:** Using the `synchronized` keyword to control access to critical sections.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `public synchronized void increment() {     count++; }`
        
    - **Volatile keyword:** Ensuring visibility of changes to variables across threads.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `private volatile boolean flag = true;`
        
    - **Using atomic classes:** Such as `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, etc., from `java.util.concurrent.atomic`.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0); count.incrementAndGet();`
        
    - **Using `Lock` and `ReentrantLock`:** From `java.util.concurrent.locks` package.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); lock.lock(); try {     // critical section } finally {     lock.unlock(); }`
        
    - **Using high-level concurrency utilities:** Like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, etc., from `java.util.concurrent`.
6. **What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?**
    
    - **Synchronized method:** Locks the entire method. It is less granular.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {     // code }`
        
    - **Synchronized block:** Locks a specific block of code. It allows for finer control over the lock.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `public void someMethod() {     synchronized(this) {         // synchronized code     } }`
        
7. **What is the `volatile` keyword in Java and when do you use it?**
    
    - The `volatile` keyword ensures that a variable's value is always read from and written to the main memory, not from a thread's local cache. It is used when you have multiple threads accessing and modifying a variable.
8. **What is a deadlock and how can you avoid it?**
    
    - A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release a resource.
    - **Avoiding deadlocks:**
        - Avoid nested locks.
        - Avoid unnecessary locks.
        - Use `tryLock()` with a timeout.
        - Lock ordering: Always acquire locks in a fixed order.
9. **What are the different states of a thread in Java?**
    
    - **New:** When a thread is created but not yet started.
    - **Runnable:** When a thread is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.
    - **Blocked:** When a thread is waiting to acquire a lock.
    - **Waiting:** When a thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action.
    - **Timed Waiting:** When a thread is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time.
    - **Terminated:** When a thread has completed execution.
10. **What is the difference between `wait()` and `sleep()` in Java?**
    
    - `wait()`: Causes the current thread to wait until another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()` on the same object. It must be called from within a synchronized context.
    - `sleep()`: Causes the current thread to sleep for a specified period of time. It does not release any locks.

### Practice Questions

1. Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of `synchronized` keyword for thread safety.
2. Explain how `ConcurrentHashMap` works and why it is thread-safe.
3. Write a Java program to create a deadlock scenario and explain how to resolve it.
4. Explain the differences between `CyclicBarrier` and `CountDownLatch`.
5. Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of `ReentrantLock`.

ChatGPT

Sure, I'd be happy to help you review some algorithm complexity questions for your Java interview. Here are some key concepts and questions related to algorithm complexity:

### Algorithm Complexity Questions

1. **What is algorithm complexity and why is it important?**
    
    - Algorithm complexity refers to the amount of computational resources (time and space) that an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It is important because it helps in analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and choosing the most suitable one for a given problem.
2. **What is Big O notation?**
    
    - Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements in terms of the input size. It provides an asymptotic analysis of the algorithm's performance.
3. **Explain the different types of time complexities with examples.**
    
    - **O(1) - Constant Time:** The running time is independent of the input size.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `public int getFirstElement(int[] array) {     return array[0]; }`

        `public void printAllPairs(int[] array) {     for (int i : array) {         for (int j : array) {             System.out.println(i + ", " + j);         }     } }`
        
    - **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time:** The running time grows logarithmically with the input size.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `public int binarySearch(int[] array, int key) {     int left = 0;     int right = array.length - 1;     while (left <= right) {         int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;         if (array[mid] == key) {             return mid;         }         if (array[mid] < key) {             left = mid + 1;         } else {             right = mid - 1;         }     }     return -1; }`
        
    - **O(n log n):** Common in algorithms like mergesort and quicksort.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `public void mergeSort(int[] array, int left, int right) {     if (left < right) {         int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;         mergeSort(array, left, mid);         mergeSort(array, mid + 1, right);         merge(array, left, mid, right);     } }`
        
4. **Explain the different types of space complexities with examples.**
    
    - **O(1) - Constant Space:** The space required is constant regardless of the input size.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `public void printElement(int[] array) {     System.out.println(array[0]); }`
        
    - **O(n) - Linear Space:** The space required grows linearly with the input size.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `public int[] duplicateArray(int[] array) {     int[] newArray = new int[array.length];     for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {         newArray[i] = array[i];     }     return newArray; }`
        
5. **What is the difference between time complexity and space complexity?**
    
    - **Time Complexity:** Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.
    - **Space Complexity:** Measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.
6. **What is amortized analysis?**
    
    - Amortized analysis is a method used to average the time complexity of an algorithm over a sequence of operations, ensuring that the average time per operation is small, even if some operations might be expensive occasionally.

### Practice Questions

1. **Analyze the time complexity of the following code:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `public void example(int n) {     for (int i = 1; i < n; i = i * 2) {         for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {             System.out.println("Hello");         }     } }`
    
    - The outer loop runs `log(n)` times because `i` is multiplied by 2 each time. The inner loop runs `i` times, which is `2^k` times in the `k`th iteration. The overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
2. **Write a Java function to perform bubble sort and analyze its time and space complexity.**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `public void bubbleSort(int[] array) {     int n = array.length;     for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {         for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {             if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {                 int temp = array[j];                 array[j] = array[j + 1];                 array[j + 1] = temp;             }         }     } }`
    
    - **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.
    - **Space Complexity:** O(1).
3. **Explain the time complexity of quicksort and its best, average, and worst-case scenarios.**
    
    - **Best and Average Case:** O(n log n) when the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal halves.
    - **Worst Case:** O(n^2) when the pivot is the smallest or largest element, resulting in highly unbalanced partitions.
4. **Write a Java function to merge two sorted arrays and analyze its time and space complexity.**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `public int[] merge(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {     int n1 = arr1.length;     int n2 = arr2.length;     int[] result = new int[n1 + n2];     int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;     while (i < n1 && j < n2) {         if (arr1[i] <= arr2[j]) {             result[k++] = arr1[i++];         } else {             result[k++] = arr2[j++];         }     }     while (i < n1) {         result[k++] = arr1[i++];     }     while (j < n2) {         result[k++] = arr2[j++];     }     return result; }`
    
    - **Time Complexity:** O(n1 + n2).
    - **Space Complexity:** O(n1 + n2).
5. **What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an ArrayList and a LinkedList in Java?**
    
    - **ArrayList:** O(1) for accessing an element by index because it is backed by an array.
    - **LinkedList:** O(n) for accessing an element by index because it requires traversal from the head of the list.

        `import java.io.OutputStream; import java.net.HttpURLConnection; import java.net.URL;  public class HttpPostExample {     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {         URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com");         HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();         con.setRequestMethod("POST");         con.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");         con.setDoOutput(true);          String urlParameters = "name=John&age=30";         try (OutputStream os = con.getOutputStream()) {             byte[] input = urlParameters.getBytes("utf-8");             os.write(input, 0, input.length);         }          int responseCode = con.getResponseCode();         System.out.println("POST Response Code :: " + responseCode);          if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {             BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));             String inputLine;             StringBuffer response = new StringBuffer();              while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {                 response.append(inputLine);             }             in.close();             System.out.println(response.toString());         } else {             System.out.println("POST request not worked");         }     } }`
        
8. **What are HTTP headers and why are they important?**
    
    - HTTP headers are key-value pairs in HTTP requests and responses that provide additional information about the request or response. They are important for defining the content type, length, server information, client information, caching policies, and more.

### Practice Questions

1. **Explain the difference between `GET` and `POST` requests.**
    
    - **GET:**
        - Retrieves data from the server.
        - Parameters are included in the URL.
        - Generally used for fetching data.
        - Can be cached and bookmarked.
        - Limited length due to URL length restrictions.
    - **POST:**
        - Sends data to the server for processing.
        - Parameters are included in the request body.
        - Generally used for creating or updating data.
        - Not cached or bookmarked.
        - No size limit on the data being sent.
2. **What is the purpose of the `Content-Type` header in an HTTP request?**
    
    - The `Content-Type` header indicates the media type of the resource or the data being sent to the server. For example, `application/json` for JSON data, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for form data, etc.
3. **How do you handle HTTP redirects in Java using `HttpURLConnection`?**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.InputStreamReader; import java.net.HttpURLConnection; import java.net.URL;  public class HttpRedirectExample {     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {         URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com");         HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();         con.setInstanceFollowRedirects(true); // or con.setFollowRedirects(true);          int responseCode = con.getResponseCode();         if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_TEMP ||             responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM) {             String newUrl = con.getHeaderField("Location");             System.out.println("Redirected to: " + newUrl);         } else {             BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream()));             String inputLine;             StringBuffer response = new StringBuffer();              while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {                 response.append(inputLine);             }             in.close();             System.out.println(response.toString());         }     } }`
    
4. **What is the purpose of the `Accept` header in an HTTP request?**
    
    - The `Accept` header informs the server about the types of media that the client can process. For example, `Accept: application/json` tells the server that the client expects a JSON response.
5. **How can you add custom headers to an HTTP request in Java using `HttpURLConnection`?**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com"); HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); con.setRequestMethod("GET"); con.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0"); con.setRequestProperty("Custom-Header", "CustomValue");`

Absolutely! Hibernate is a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java. Here are some key concepts and common questions related to Hibernate that you might encounter in a Java interview:

### Hibernate Questions

1. **What is Hibernate?**
    
    - Hibernate is an ORM framework for Java applications. It simplifies the development of Java applications to interact with the database. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.
2. **What are the main advantages of using Hibernate?**
    
    - **Simplifies Database Interactions:** Automates the creation and management of SQL queries.
    - **Portable:** Supports multiple databases with minimal configuration changes.
    - **Reduces Boilerplate Code:** Automates CRUD operations and reduces boilerplate code.
    - **Caching:** Supports first-level and second-level caching.
    - **Lazy Loading:** Loads data on demand.
3. **What is an ORM tool?**
    
    - An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool is a framework that allows developers to map Java objects to database tables and vice versa. It handles the conversion between the object-oriented and relational paradigms.
4. **What are the core components of Hibernate?**
    
    - **Configuration:** Contains database and mapping configurations.
    - **SessionFactory:** A factory for creating `Session` objects.
    - **Session:** A single-threaded, short-lived object that represents a conversation between the application and the database.
    - **Transaction:** Manages transactions in Hibernate.
    - **Query:** Represents an HQL or SQL query.
5. **What is the difference between `Session` and `SessionFactory` in Hibernate?**
    
    - **SessionFactory:** A thread-safe, heavyweight object that is responsible for creating `Session` objects. It is usually created once per application.
    - **Session:** A single-threaded, lightweight object that represents a conversation between the application and the database. It is used to perform CRUD operations and query the database.
6. **What is the difference between `get()` and `load()` methods in Hibernate?**
    
    - **get():** Returns the object from the database or null if the object is not found. It always hits the database.
    - **load():** Returns a proxy object or throws an exception if the object is not found. It does not hit the database unless the object is accessed.
7. **What is a Hibernate configuration file?**
    
    - The Hibernate configuration file (usually `hibernate.cfg.xml`) contains database connection settings, Hibernate properties, and mappings between Java classes and database tables.
        
        xml
        
        Copy code
        
        `<hibernate-configuration>     <session-factory>         <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>         <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</property>         <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb</property>         <property name="hibernate.connection.username">root</property>         <property name="hibernate.connection.password">root</property>         <mapping resource="com/example/Employee.hbm.xml"/>     </session-factory> </hibernate-configuration>`
        
8. **What are the different states of an object in Hibernate?**
    
    - **Transient:** The object is not associated with a Hibernate session and does not have a corresponding row in the database.
    - **Persistent:** The object is associated with a Hibernate session and has a corresponding row in the database.
    - **Detached:** The object was associated with a Hibernate session, but the session is closed.
9. **What is the difference between HQL and SQL?**
    
    - **HQL (Hibernate Query Language):** An object-oriented query language that works with Hibernate's object model and allows querying against the database using Java objects.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `String hql = "FROM Employee E WHERE E.id = :employee_id"; Query query = session.createQuery(hql); query.setParameter("employee_id", 10); List results = query.list();`
        
    - **SQL (Structured Query Language):** A query language that works directly with the database tables and columns.
        
        sql
        
        Copy code
        
        `SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE id = 10;`
        
10. **What is the purpose of the `@Entity` annotation in Hibernate?**
    
    - The `@Entity` annotation specifies that the class is an entity and is mapped to a database table.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@Entity @Table(name = "EMPLOYEE") public class Employee {     @Id     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)     @Column(name = "ID")     private int id;      @Column(name = "NAME")     private String name;      // getters and setters }`
        

### Practice Questions

1. **What are the different types of associations in Hibernate?**
    
    - **One-to-One:** One entity is associated with one other entity.
    - **One-to-Many:** One entity is associated with multiple other entities.
    - **Many-to-One:** Multiple entities are associated with one other entity.
    - **Many-to-Many:** Multiple entities are associated with multiple other entities.
2. **How do you configure a one-to-many relationship in Hibernate?**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `@Entity public class Department {     @Id     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)     @Column(name = "ID")     private int id;      @Column(name = "NAME")     private String name;      @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)     private Set<Employee> employees;      // getters and setters }  @Entity public class Employee {     @Id     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)     @Column(name = "ID")     private int id;      @Column(name = "NAME")     private String name;      @ManyToOne     @JoinColumn(name = "DEPARTMENT_ID")     private Department department;      // getters and setters }`
    
3. **What is the purpose of the `@GeneratedValue` annotation in Hibernate?**
    
    - The `@GeneratedValue` annotation is used to specify the generation strategy for the primary key. Common strategies include `AUTO`, `IDENTITY`, `SEQUENCE`, and `TABLE`.
4. **How do you enable second-level caching in Hibernate?**
    
    - Add the caching provider dependency (e.g., Ehcache).
    - Enable second-level cache in `hibernate.cfg.xml`.
        
        xml
        
        Copy code
        
        `<property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">true</property> <property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory</property>`
        
    - Configure caching for entities using annotations.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@Entity @Cacheable @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_WRITE) public class Employee {     // fields, getters, and setters }`
        
5. **What is the purpose of the `@JoinColumn` annotation in Hibernate?**
    
    - The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to specify the foreign key column in an association. It is applied to the owning side of the relationship.

Certainly! The Spring Framework is a comprehensive framework for building enterprise-grade Java applications. Here are some key concepts and common questions related to the Spring Framework that you might encounter in a Java interview:

### Spring Framework Questions

1. **What is the Spring Framework?**
    
    - The Spring Framework is a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. It provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications and helps manage application components through dependency injection.
2. **What are the main features of the Spring Framework?**
    
    - **Inversion of Control (IoC):** Manages the lifecycle and dependencies of objects using the IoC container.
    - **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):** Supports cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management.
    - **Data Access:** Simplifies database access with support for JDBC, ORM frameworks (like Hibernate), and transaction management.
    - **MVC Framework:** Provides a powerful MVC framework for building web applications.
    - **Integration:** Integrates with various enterprise services like messaging, email, caching, and scheduling.
3. **What is Inversion of Control (IoC) in Spring?**
    
    - IoC is a design principle where the control of creating and managing objects is transferred from the application code to the Spring IoC container. This is typically achieved through dependency injection.
4. **What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**
    
    - DI is a design pattern used to implement IoC. It allows an object to define its dependencies without creating them. These dependencies are injected by the Spring container at runtime. There are three types of DI: constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection.
5. **What are the different types of Spring Bean scopes?**
    
    - **Singleton:** (Default) A single instance per Spring IoC container.
    - **Prototype:** A new instance for each request.
    - **Request:** A single instance per HTTP request (web applications).
    - **Session:** A single instance per HTTP session (web applications).
    - **GlobalSession:** A single instance per global HTTP session (web applications).
6. **What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` annotations in Spring?**
    
    - `@Component`: A generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
    - `@Service`: A specialization of `@Component` for service-layer classes.
    - `@Repository`: A specialization of `@Component` for data access objects (DAOs). It also provides exception translation for database exceptions.
    - `@Controller`: A specialization of `@Component` for web controllers.
7. **How do you define a Spring Bean?**
    
    - **Using XML configuration:**
        
        xml
        
        Copy code
        
        `<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean"/>`
        
    - **Using Java configuration:**
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@Configuration public class AppConfig {     @Bean     public MyBean myBean() {         return new MyBean();     } }`
        
    - **Using annotations:**
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@Component public class MyBean { }`
        
8. **What is Spring AOP?**
    
    - Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) provides a way to modularize cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management. It allows you to define advice (code) that can be applied at specific join points (method executions) in your application.
9. **What are the different types of advice in Spring AOP?**
    
    - **Before Advice:** Runs before a method execution.
    - **After Advice:** Runs after a method execution, regardless of its outcome.
    - **After Returning Advice:** Runs after a method returns successfully.
    - **After Throwing Advice:** Runs after a method throws an exception.
    - **Around Advice:** Runs before and after a method execution.
10. **What is the Spring MVC framework?**
    
    - Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building web applications. It separates the application into three interconnected components: the model (data), the view (UI), and the controller (handles user input). Spring MVC provides a clean separation of concerns and simplifies the development of web applications.

### Practice Questions

1. **How do you handle exceptions in Spring MVC?**
    
    - **Using `@ExceptionHandler` annotation:**
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@Controller public class MyController {     @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)     public ModelAndView handleException(Exception e) {         ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("error");         mav.addObject("message", e.getMessage());         return mav;     } }`
        
    - **Using `@ControllerAdvice` annotation for global exception handling:**
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@ControllerAdvice public class GlobalExceptionHandler {     @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)     public ModelAndView handleException(Exception e) {         ModelAndView mav = new ModelAndView("error");         mav.addObject("message", e.getMessage());         return mav;     } }`
        
2. **What is the purpose of the `@RequestMapping` annotation?**
    
    - The `@RequestMapping` annotation is used to map web requests to specific handler methods in a controller. It can be applied at both the class and method level.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@Controller @RequestMapping("/home") public class HomeController {     @RequestMapping("/welcome")     public String welcome() {         return "welcome";     } }`
        
3. **What is the difference between `@RequestParam` and `@PathVariable` annotations in Spring MVC?**
    
    - `@RequestParam`: Used to extract query parameters from the request URL.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@RequestMapping("/greet") public String greet(@RequestParam("name") String name) {     return "Hello, " + name; }`
        
    - `@PathVariable`: Used to extract values from the URI.
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@RequestMapping("/user/{id}") public String getUser(@PathVariable("id") int id) {     return "User ID: " + id; }`
        
4. **What is the Spring Boot Starter Web?**
    
    - Spring Boot Starter Web is a starter dependency for building web applications using Spring MVC. It includes dependencies like Spring MVC, Jackson (for JSON processing), and an embedded Tomcat server.
        
        xml
        
        Copy code
        
        `<dependency>     <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>     <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId> </dependency>`
        
5. **How do you configure a data source in Spring?**
    
    - **Using XML configuration:**
        
        xml
        
        Copy code
        
        `<bean id="dataSource" class="org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DriverManagerDataSource">     <property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>     <property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"/>     <property name="username" value="root"/>     <property name="password" value="root"/> </bean>`
        
    - **Using Java configuration:**
        
        java
        
        Copy code
        
        `@Configuration public class DataSourceConfig {     @Bean     public DataSource dataSource() {         DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource();         dataSource.setDriverClassName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");         dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb");         dataSource.setUsername("root");         dataSource.setPassword("root");         return dataSource;     } }`
