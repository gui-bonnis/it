Integrating three Java microservices that use different API technologies—REST, WebFlux, and GraphQL—can be approached in a structured way to ensure seamless communication and functionality across the services. Here’s how each service could be integrated while maintaining their unique API styles:

### 1. **Microservice 1: REST-based API (using Spring Boot)**

- **Technology**: Typically uses Spring Boot with `@RestController` annotations.
- **Integration**:
    - Other services can communicate with this service via standard HTTP requests using REST conventions.
    - Requests can be made using libraries like `RestTemplate` (blocking) or `WebClient` (non-blocking) in other microservices.
    - The REST service might expose endpoints like `GET /resource/{id}` or `POST /resource`.

### 2. **Microservice 2: WebFlux-based API (using Reactive Programming)**

- **Technology**: Uses Spring WebFlux for non-blocking, reactive APIs.
- **Integration**:
    - Communication between this service and other microservices can occur via non-blocking `WebClient` (also reactive).
    - The WebFlux service might use `Mono` or `Flux` to handle asynchronous, non-blocking data streams.
    - To communicate with REST-based or GraphQL-based services, `WebClient` can be used to make requests without blocking the event loop.
    - The service could expose endpoints like `GET /reactive-resource` and return a `Mono<Response>` or `Flux<Response>`.

### 3. **Microservice 3: GraphQL-based API**

- **Technology**: Uses a Spring Boot GraphQL implementation (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-graphql`).
- **Integration**:
    - This service exposes a GraphQL schema, which allows clients or other services to query or mutate data via GraphQL queries.
    - Other microservices can use `WebClient` to send HTTP POST requests with GraphQL queries or mutations.
    - The service could expose an endpoint like `POST /graphql`, where the request body contains the query (e.g., `{ resource(id: 1) { field1, field2 } }`).
    - The GraphQL API can also act as a data aggregator, combining responses from REST or WebFlux services as part of resolving GraphQL queries.

### **Integrating the Three Services**

Each microservice communicates using HTTP but differs in how it processes and responds to requests:

- **Service-to-Service Communication**:
    - Use `RestTemplate` or `WebClient` for communication between microservices. Since `WebClient` is non-blocking and works well in both REST and reactive contexts, it's often the better choice for integration.
    - For instance, the REST or WebFlux service can call the GraphQL service by sending a POST request to its `/graphql` endpoint with a query.
    - The WebFlux service can call the REST service and handle the response reactively using `WebClient`.
- **Service Composition**:
    - If one service aggregates data from the other two, it could be designed to call both REST and WebFlux services, gather the responses, and return a combined result.
    - For example, the GraphQL service could resolve a query by calling both the REST and WebFlux services using their respective APIs.
- **API Gateway**:
    - Optionally, an API Gateway (like Spring Cloud Gateway) can be introduced to route requests to the appropriate microservice based on the API technology (REST, WebFlux, or GraphQL) and provide a unified entry point for clients.

### **Example Scenario:**

- **Client makes a request to the GraphQL service** to get detailed information about a resource.
    - The GraphQL service queries the REST service for basic resource details (`WebClient` to `GET /resource/{id}`).
    - It simultaneously queries the WebFlux service to get additional asynchronous data streams (`WebClient` to `GET /reactive-resource`).
    - Once the data from both services is received, the GraphQL service assembles the data and responds to the client with the requested information.

This kind of integration allows each microservice to leverage its specific API paradigm while still communicating effectively with others.
