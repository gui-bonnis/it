How should I set the org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect in my application.yml

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To set the `org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect` in your `application.yml`, you need to configure the Hibernate properties under the `spring.jpa` section. Here is an example configuration:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase     username: yourusername     password: yourpassword   jpa:     hibernate:       ddl-auto: update     properties:       hibernate:         dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect`

In this example:

- `spring.datasource.url` is the JDBC URL for your PostgreSQL database.
- `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password` are the credentials for your PostgreSQL database.
- `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` is set to `update` to automatically update the database schema based on the entity mappings. You can adjust this based on your needs (e.g., `validate`, `create`, `create-drop`, `none`).
- `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect` specifies the Hibernate dialect to use, which is `org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect` for PostgreSQL.

Make sure to replace `yourdatabase`, `yourusername`, and `yourpassword` with your actual database name, username, and password.

ChatGPT

To remove the message `spring.jpa.open-in-view is enabled by default. Therefore, database queries may be performed during view rendering`, you need to disable the `open-in-view` setting in your `application.yml` or `application.properties` file. This setting controls whether the persistence context (the session) is kept open during the rendering of a web view.

In your `application.yml`, you can add the following configuration to disable `open-in-view`:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   jpa:     open-in-view: false`

Or in your `application.properties`, you can add:

properties

Copy code

`spring.jpa.open-in-view=false`

Disabling this setting can help avoid issues related to the persistence context being open for too long, which can lead to lazy loading exceptions and other performance issues. Once you add this configuration, the message should no longer appear in your logs, and the `open-in-view` feature will be disabled.

What should I do, about this message "main] o.s.c.annotation.AnnotationTypeMapping : Support for convention-based annotation attribute overrides is deprecated and will be removed in Spring Framework 6.2. Please annotate the following attributes in @org.springframework.retry.annotation.EnableRetry with appropriate @AliasFor declarations: [proxyTargetClass]"

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The message indicates that support for convention-based annotation attribute overrides is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Spring (6.2). Specifically, it points out that attributes in the `@EnableRetry` annotation should be explicitly annotated with `@AliasFor`.

To resolve this warning, you need to update your usage of `@EnableRetry` to ensure it includes `@AliasFor` declarations where needed. However, `@EnableRetry` is part of the Spring Retry module, so you may need to wait for an update from the Spring Retry project to address this deprecation.

In the meantime, you can suppress the warning by making sure your code uses the updated practices as recommended by Spring. If you control the definition of the `@EnableRetry` annotation, you can add the `@AliasFor` annotation to the attributes. If not, you may need to check for updates or contribute to the Spring Retry project.

Here's an example of how to use `@AliasFor` in a custom annotation:

java

Copy code

`import org.springframework.core.annotation.AliasFor; import org.springframework.retry.annotation.EnableRetry; import org.springframework.retry.annotation.RetryConfiguration; import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;  @Target(ElementType.TYPE) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @EnableRetry @Component public @interface MyRetryableComponent {      @AliasFor(annotation = Component.class, attribute = "value")     String value() default "";      @AliasFor(annotation = EnableRetry.class, attribute = "proxyTargetClass")     boolean proxyTargetClass() default false; }`

If `@EnableRetry` is provided by a library and you cannot modify it directly, consider checking the library's documentation or source code repository for any updates or instructions regarding this deprecation notice.

To avoid the warning until the library is updated, you could suppress the log message, but this is generally not recommended as a long-term solution. The preferred approach is to keep your dependencies up to date and follow best practices as advised by the framework's maintainers.

If you need further assistance with specific details, please provide more context or check the Spring Framework and Spring Retry documentation for the latest recommendations.

My EnableRetry is set on my Application main class. @EnableRetry public class SiaaIntegracaoTotvsCoreApiApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(SiaaIntegracaoTotvsCoreApiApplication.class, args); } } Where should I put it

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Given that `@EnableRetry` is applied directly to your main application class, you should not need to create a custom annotation. Instead, you should ensure that your Spring dependencies are up-to-date, as newer versions of Spring Retry might already address this deprecation warning.

However, if the deprecation warning persists and you are using the latest versions, you can consider suppressing the specific log warning. Here are a few ways to handle it:

1. **Check for Updates:** Ensure that you are using the latest version of Spring Framework and Spring Retry. Newer versions may have resolved this deprecation issue.
    
2. **Suppress the Warning Log:** You can configure your logging framework to suppress this specific warning if updating dependencies is not an option. For example, if you are using Logback, you can add a filter to your `logback.xml` configuration:
    
    xml
    
    Copy code
    
    `<configuration>     <logger name="org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotationTypeMapping" level="ERROR"/> </configuration>`
    
3. **Modify the Annotation:** Since `@EnableRetry` is part of Spring Retry, if updating dependencies does not resolve the issue, you can manually suppress this warning for now. Alternatively, if you have control over how `@EnableRetry` is configured in your project, you could use custom annotations with `@AliasFor` as mentioned previously.
    
4. **Suppress Warnings with @SuppressWarnings:** Although not ideal, you can use `@SuppressWarnings` to ignore specific warnings in Java code. However, this will not work for log messages and is not a recommended practice for resolving deprecation warnings in configurations.
    

Here is an example of updating your `application.yml` to suppress logs for a specific package:

yaml

Copy code

`logging:   level:     org.springframework.core.annotation.AnnotationTypeMapping: ERROR`

Ultimately, the best long-term solution is to keep your dependencies updated and follow best practices as recommended by the Spring Framework. This ensures compatibility and stability as you upgrade to newer versions of the framework.

How can I remove changes log from liquibase on spring boot application

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

If you want to remove or rollback changes that have been applied by Liquibase in your Spring Boot application, you can use Liquibase commands to rollback the changes. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### 1. Rollback Last Changes

You can rollback the last changes using the `rollback` command with the appropriate tag or by specifying the number of changesets to rollback.

#### Rollback Using a Tag

If you have tagged your changesets, you can rollback to a specific tag. Add the following to your `application.yml` or `application.properties`:

yaml

Copy code

`liquibase:   rollback-tag: YOUR_TAG_NAME`

Or in `application.properties`:

properties

Copy code

`liquibase.rollback-tag=YOUR_TAG_NAME`

Then run the application with the `rollback` goal. This can be done via command line or as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

#### Rollback Last N Changes

You can also rollback a specific number of changesets:

yaml

Copy code

`liquibase:   rollback-count: 1`

Or in `application.properties`:

properties

Copy code

`liquibase.rollback-count=1`

### 2. Rollback to a Specific Date

You can rollback to a specific date by using the `rollbackDate` command.

#### Using Application Properties

properties

Copy code

`liquibase.rollback-date=2023-07-01T12:00:00`

### 3. Using Liquibase CLI

You can also use the Liquibase Command Line Interface (CLI) to rollback changes. This requires having Liquibase installed and configured.

#### Rollback Last Changes Using CLI

sh

Copy code

`liquibase --changeLogFile=src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml rollbackCount 1`

#### Rollback to a Specific Tag Using CLI

sh

Copy code

`liquibase --changeLogFile=src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml rollback YOUR_TAG_NAME`

#### Rollback to a Specific Date Using CLI

sh

Copy code

`liquibase --changeLogFile=src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml rollbackToDate YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`

### 4. Removing ChangeLog Tables

If you want to completely remove Liquibase tracking tables (like `DATABASECHANGELOG` and `DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK`), you can manually drop these tables from your database. Be cautious with this approach as it will remove all Liquibase tracking information.

#### Dropping Tables Using

I want to remove the message, not rollback the process. I just want to "clean" my log

###### ChatGPT said:

To remove the Liquibase change log messages from your Spring Boot application logs, you can adjust the logging level for Liquibase. This can be done by configuring your logging framework to suppress or change the log level for Liquibase-related logs.

### Adjusting Log Levels in `application.yml`

You can configure the logging levels in your `application.yml` file as follows:

yaml

Copy code

`logging:   level:     liquibase: WARN`

### Adjusting Log Levels in `application.properties`

Alternatively, you can set the logging levels in your `application.properties` file:

properties

Copy code

`logging.level.liquibase=warn`

By setting the logging level to `WARN`, you will suppress `INFO` level messages, including the changes log messages from Liquibase.

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how your `application.yml` might look with this configuration:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase     username: yourusername     password: yourpassword   jpa:     hibernate:       ddl-auto: update     properties:       hibernate:         dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect  logging:   level:     liquibase: WARN`

Or in `application.properties`:

properties

Copy code

`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase spring.datasource.username=yourusername spring.datasource.password=yourpassword spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect  logging.level.liquibase=warn`

This configuration will keep the Liquibase messages from cluttering your log by only showing warnings and errors.

This message I want to not show on my logs: UPDATE SUMMARY Run: 0 Previously run: 28 Filtered out: 0 ------------------------------- Total change sets: 28

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To suppress the specific Liquibase summary messages in your Spring Boot application logs, you need to adjust the logging configuration for the Liquibase `update` command, which is typically logged at the `INFO` level. Setting the logging level for Liquibase to `WARN` or higher should suppress these summary messages.

Here is how you can adjust the logging configuration in your `application.yml` or `application.properties` file:

### Adjusting Log Levels in `application.yml`

yaml

Copy code

`logging:   level:     liquibase: WARN`

### Adjusting Log Levels in `application.properties`

properties

Copy code

`logging.level.liquibase=WARN`

### Example Configuration

Here is an example of how your `application.yml` might look with this configuration:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   datasource:     url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase     username: yourusername     password: yourpassword   jpa:     hibernate:       ddl-auto: update     properties:       hibernate:         dialect: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect  logging:   level:     liquibase: WARN`

Or in `application.properties`:

properties

Copy code

`spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdatabase spring.datasource.username=yourusername spring.datasource.password=yourpassword spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect  logging.level.liquibase=WARN`

By setting the logging level for Liquibase to `WARN`, you should suppress the `INFO` level messages, including the update summary.

### Fine-Grained Control (if needed)

If you still see messages and need more fine-grained control, you may need to specifically configure logging for the `liquibase.changelog` package. Here's how you can do that:

#### In `application.yml`

yaml

Copy code

`logging:   level:     liquibase: WARN     liquibase.changelog: WARN`

#### In `application.properties`

properties

Copy code

`logging.level.liquibase=WARN logging.level.liquibase.changelog=WARN`

These configurations should help you clean up your logs by suppressing the specific summary messages from Liquibase.

I changed my spring logging level, but the message still shows up

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

If changing the logging level to `WARN` doesn't suppress the Liquibase summary messages, you might need to try setting a more specific logging configuration. Here are a few more steps you can try:

### 1. Fine-Grained Control over Liquibase Logging

Set a more specific logging level for the Liquibase packages that handle the update summary messages. Try adjusting the logging levels for the `liquibase.executor` and `liquibase.database` packages as well:

#### In `application.yml`

yaml

Copy code

`logging:   level:     liquibase: WARN     liquibase.executor: WARN     liquibase.database: WARN`

#### In `application.properties`

properties

Copy code

`logging.level.liquibase=WARN logging.level.liquibase.executor=WARN logging.level.liquibase.database=WARN`

### 2. Overriding Default Logging Configuration

Ensure that your custom logging configuration is taking precedence. Double-check your `logback.xml` or other logging configuration files to ensure there are no conflicting settings.

#### Example `logback-spring.xml`

If you are using Logback, you can create or update the `logback-spring.xml` file in your `src/main/resources` directory:

xml

Copy code

`<configuration>     <logger name="liquibase" level="WARN"/>     <logger name="liquibase.executor" level="WARN"/>     <logger name="liquibase.database" level="WARN"/>     <root level="INFO">         <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE"/>     </root> </configuration>`

### 3. Disabling Specific Logging Programmatically

If the logging configuration still doesn't suppress the message, you might consider disabling it programmatically within your Spring Boot application. This is a less common approach but can be effective:

#### Custom Logging Configuration

You can create a custom logging configuration class to suppress specific log messages:

java

Copy code

`import ch.qos.logback.classic.Level; import ch.qos.logback.classic.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;  import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;  @Configuration public class CustomLoggingConfiguration {      @PostConstruct     public void init() {         Logger liquibaseLogger = (Logger) LoggerFactory.getLogger("liquibase");         liquibaseLogger.setLevel(Level.WARN);          Logger liquibaseExecutorLogger = (Logger) LoggerFactory.getLogger("liquibase.executor");         liquibaseExecutorLogger.setLevel(Level.WARN);          Logger liquibaseDatabaseLogger = (Logger) LoggerFactory.getLogger("liquibase.database");         liquibaseDatabaseLogger.setLevel(Level.WARN);     } }`

Add this configuration class to your project, and it will adjust the logging levels at runtime.

### Summary

These additional steps should help you suppress the Liquibase summary messages:

1. **Fine-Grained Logging Configuration**: Adjust specific Liquibase package log levels.
2. **Override Default Logging Configuration**: Ensure no conflicting settings in `logback.xml`.
3. **Programmatic Logging Control**: Suppress specific log messages programmatically.

By using these methods, you should be able to clean up your logs effectively.
