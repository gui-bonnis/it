can you show me an example of throw inside a stream map

In Java Streams, you can use the `throw` statement inside a `map` operation, but it must be wrapped in a lambda expression. Since streams are meant to process elements in a functional way, directly throwing exceptions in the stream pipeline isn't common, but it's possible for certain scenarios like validation or error handling.

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

java

Copy code

`import java.util.List; import java.util.stream.Collectors;  public class Main {     public static void main(String[] args) {         List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "", "Charlie");          try {             // Use map to process the stream, and throw an exception for empty names             List<String> upperCaseNames = names.stream()                 .map(name -> {                     if (name.isEmpty()) {                         throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be empty");                     }                     return name.toUpperCase();                 })                 .collect(Collectors.toList());                          System.out.println(upperCaseNames);         } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {             System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());         }     } }`

### Explanation:

- We have a list of names, and during the `map` operation, we throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the name is empty.
- The stream processes each name, converts it to uppercase, and throws the exception if it encounters an invalid entry.
- The exception is caught in the `try-catch` block around the stream processing.

This example demonstrates how to handle exceptions in a stream pipeline using `throw`.
