what modules should I make common or shareable if I have 2 or more microservices using this structure?

In a microservices architecture, when you have multiple services sharing certain functionality, it's important to identify which parts of your architecture can be abstracted into common or shared modules. This can reduce duplication, foster consistency, and streamline maintenance. Based on the structure you've provided, here’s how you might organize shareable modules across multiple microservices:

### Common/Shareable Modules

1. **Shared Kernel (`shared`)**
    
    - **DTOs (`shared.dto`)**: Data Transfer Objects are often shared across services to ensure consistent data structures in API requests and responses.
    - **Event Definitions (`shared.event`)**: Common event structures (e.g., domain events or integration events) that can be used across services for consistent communication (especially if using event-driven architecture).
    - **Validation (`shared.validation`)**: Shared validation logic such as utility classes, annotations, or commonly used validation routines. This can include custom annotations or validation utilities that can be reused across services.
2. **Canonical Model (`canonical`)**
    
    - The `canonical` folder contains the representation of core entities in a neutral form that can be shared across microservices, especially if they share similar domain concepts like `order`, `item`, etc.
    - **Canonical Models (`canonical.order`, `canonical.item`)**: Shared representations of entities across services, potentially representing shared business concepts like orders and items.
    - **Canonical Translators (`canonical.translator`)**: Shared transformation logic that converts between domain models and the canonical model, helping ensure consistent data representation between services.
3. **Infrastructure Layer (Partial)**
    
    - **Event Handling (`infrastructure.event`)**: If you have a common event system or event publisher mechanism (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or event sourcing), this can be shared across multiple services.
    - **Web Layer (`infrastructure.web`)**: Depending on the API standards and frameworks used, you might want to share controllers or API components for consistent error handling, authentication, and API structures.
4. **Domain Events (`domain.event`)**
    
    - If multiple services produce or react to the same events (e.g., `OrderCreatedEvent` or `OrderUpdatedEvent`), you could have a shared module for common event types or even event contracts. This module would include event types, event handler interfaces, and utility classes used to publish and subscribe to events.
5. **Persistence Layer (Partial)**
    
    - If your services share the same database (for instance, with a shared schema or if using the same database technology like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), you can abstract certain database-related functionality into a shared `persistence` module, especially repository interfaces or base classes.
    - **Repository Interfaces (`domain.repository`)**: If some repositories are common across microservices, like for shared entities or common database access patterns, these could be shared.
6. **Configuration (`infrastructure.config`)**
    
    - Configuration files that apply to multiple microservices, like those for shared databases, logging, or common infrastructure settings. For instance, database connection settings, authentication configurations, or API gateway configurations can be shared across microservices.

### Things to Keep In Mind

- **Avoid Tight Coupling**: While some components may be shared, ensure that you don't overly couple the microservices. Keep each microservice’s domain models, use cases, and services independently encapsulated where possible. Sharing too much logic across microservices can break the autonomy of each service.
- **Versioning**: For shared modules, especially DTOs and events, versioning becomes very important. If one service updates a shared DTO, it can potentially break other services that depend on the old version.
- **Testing**: Common testing utilities should be shared across services. However, each service should have its own specific test cases, especially for unit and integration tests related to the business logic.

### Summary of Shareable Modules

- **shared.dto** (Data Transfer Objects)
- **shared.event** (Event Definitions)
- **shared.validation** (Shared validation logic)
- **canonical** (Canonical models and transformations)
- **infrastructure.event** (Event handling infrastructure)
- **infrastructure.config** (Shared configurations)
- **domain.event** (Common domain events)
- **infrastructure.persistence** (Shared persistence logic, repository interfaces)

By modularizing and sharing these parts, you'll be able to avoid redundancy while still maintaining the separation of concerns and autonomy for each microservice.

Please consider the modularization you purpose plus 3 microservices, order, payment and inventory. Which repositories for version control should I create? and Why?

When you have multiple microservices (such as **Order**, **Payment**, and **Inventory**) and you're considering modularizing your architecture, version control repositories should be structured to support both independence and shared functionality. Here's how you might structure your repositories:

### 1. **Individual Microservices Repositories** (Separate Repositories for Each Microservice)

Each microservice typically has its own repository for the following reasons:

- **Autonomy**: Each microservice is a self-contained unit that can be developed, tested, deployed, and scaled independently.
    
- **Isolation of Dependencies**: Each service may have different dependency versions (e.g., libraries, Spring Boot versions), and keeping them in separate repositories ensures that dependencies don't conflict across services.
    
- **Independent CI/CD Pipelines**: Microservices may have different build, test, and deployment pipelines, so having separate repositories makes it easier to manage these pipelines.
    
    You would create repositories for:
    
    - `order-service`
    - `payment-service`
    - `inventory-service`

Each of these repositories would contain:

- Domain logic, use cases, application services, and specific API implementations for each microservice.
- Specific configurations, persistence logic (like database access), and testing for each microservice.

#### Why?

- **Autonomy**: Each service can evolve independently.
- **Scalability**: Enables independent scaling of each service based on its needs.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed independently or together based on release cycles.

### 2. **Shared Kernel Repository** (For Shared Functionality)

This repository will house code that is shared across multiple microservices. As you have several modules that can be reused across different microservices (like **DTOs**, **Events**, **Validation**, and **Canonical Models**), a shared repository ensures that common code is versioned and maintained separately from business-specific logic.

#### Shared Kernel Repository Content:

- **DTOs** (`shared.dto`)
- **Events** (`shared.event`)
- **Validation Logic** (`shared.validation`)
- **Canonical Models** (`canonical`)

This repository should be versioned carefully, especially for **DTOs** and **Events**, as changes in these shared components could affect multiple microservices. You should maintain backward compatibility or use semantic versioning (major, minor, patch versions) to ensure that services relying on this shared code are not broken by changes.

#### Why?

- **Reusability**: Shared functionality can be reused across services, which prevents duplication and inconsistency.
- **Centralized Maintenance**: Changes to shared code only need to be made in one place, reducing the overhead of updating multiple services.
- **Consistency**: Ensures all services follow the same data structure, validation, and event-driven architecture.

### 3. **Infrastructure/DevOps Repository** (For Deployment and Infrastructure Configurations)

A separate repository for infrastructure and deployment configuration can help keep the DevOps pipeline separate from the business logic. This repository would contain configurations for:

- **Kubernetes Manifests**: For deploying microservices.
- **Terraform Scripts**: For infrastructure as code (e.g., provisioning servers, configuring networking, managing cloud resources).
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Configuration for Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions pipelines to deploy and test microservices.

This repository ensures that infrastructure changes (e.g., scaling services, configuring networking) do not mix with application logic.

#### Why?

- **Clear Separation**: Separating business logic from deployment concerns makes it easier to manage both aspects independently.
- **Consistency Across Environments**: Infrastructure can be versioned and replicated across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Centralized Configuration**: Infrastructure-related code can be managed in a central place, making it easier to control versions and track changes.

### 4. **Common/Shared Library Repository** (Optional)

If you have common libraries that are used across multiple services (for example, authentication, logging, or utilities), you could create a shared library repository. This can house helper functions, generic services, and security utilities that could be reused across microservices.

#### Why?

- **Centralized Utility Management**: Any shared utility or common logic can be maintained and updated in a single place, avoiding duplication.
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Encourages reuse of common logic such as logging, error handling, or security utilities, minimizing the chance of bugs in each microservice.

### 5. **Test Repository (Optional)**

A shared test repository can be useful if you have common test utilities that are used across microservices, especially integration tests for common components (e.g., shared database, external services, or event bus).

#### Why?

- **Consistency in Testing**: Ensures common testing practices and utilities are shared across services.
- **Reuse of Mock Services**: Common mock services or test doubles for dependencies (like databases or external APIs) can be centralized.

### Suggested Repository Structure:

```text
/ order-service
  ├── src
  ├── application
  ├── domain
  ├── infrastructure
  ├── shared (if any order-specific shared logic)
  └── test

/ payment-service
  ├── src
  ├── application
  ├── domain
  ├── infrastructure
  ├── shared (if any payment-specific shared logic)
  └── test

/ inventory-service
  ├── src
  ├── application
  ├── domain
  ├── infrastructure
  ├── shared (if any inventory-specific shared logic)
  └── test

/ shared-kernel
  ├── canonical
  ├── dto
  ├── event
  ├── validation
  └── test (shared tests)

/ infrastructure
  ├── kubernetes
  ├── terraform
  └── ci-cd
```

### Summary:

- **Microservice Repositories**: Separate repositories for each service (`order-service`, `payment-service`, `inventory-service`) for autonomy and independent versioning.
- **Shared Kernel Repository**: A shared repository (`shared-kernel`) for shared DTOs, events, validation logic, and canonical models.
- **Infrastructure/DevOps Repository**: A repository for deployment, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD pipelines (`infrastructure`).
- **Shared Library Repository** (Optional): For common libraries that can be reused across services.
- **Test Repository** (Optional): Shared test utilities for integration testing and common mocks.

By structuring repositories in this way, you ensure that each microservice is isolated while still sharing common functionality and configurations where necessary.

Where should I put infrastructure setup or configuration to run locally, like Sonar, ArgoCD, Vault, and any other service that might be running for allow me to run my service locally.

To organize the infrastructure setup or configuration for running services like **SonarQube**, **ArgoCD**, **Vault**, and any other services needed for local development, you should create a dedicated repository (or submodules, depending on the complexity) that manages your local development environment. This repository would contain all the configurations, deployment manifests, and automation scripts required to run these services locally. The goal is to have a clear separation of concerns between your application logic (microservices) and the local environment setup.

Here are the different approaches you can take:

### 1. **Infrastructure Setup Repository (Local Dev Environment)**

Create a repository specifically dedicated to setting up the local development environment, which will include all services and tools you need for local development, testing, and debugging. This can include services like SonarQube, ArgoCD, Vault, and others that support the microservices you are building.

#### Repository Structure:

```text
/ local-dev-environment
  ├── docker-compose.yml        # Docker Compose file to run local services
  ├── k8s                       # Kubernetes manifests for local (MicroK8s) deployment
  │   ├── sonarqube.yaml        # ArgoCD, Vault, SonarQube, etc. manifests
  │   ├── argocd.yaml           # ArgoCD setup YAML
  │   └── vault.yaml            # Vault setup YAML
  ├── terraform                 # Terraform configurations for infrastructure provisioning
  │   ├── sonarqube.tf          # Terraform setup for SonarQube
  │   ├── vault.tf              # Terraform setup for Vault
  │   └── argocd.tf             # Terraform setup for ArgoCD
  ├── scripts                   # Shell scripts or automation scripts to deploy and configure services
  │   ├── setup-sonar.sh        # Scripts for local setup of SonarQube
  │   ├── setup-vault.sh        # Scripts for local setup of Vault
  │   └── setup-argocd.sh       # Scripts for local setup of ArgoCD
  ├── helm                      # Helm charts for deployment (if applicable)
  ├── config                    # Configuration files (e.g., vault configuration, ArgoCD setup)
  │   ├── sonar-config.json     # SonarQube configuration files
  │   └── vault-config.hcl      # Vault config files
  └── README.md                 # Documentation for setting up and using the local dev environment
```

#### Why?

- **Centralized Setup**: It centralizes the setup of all services required for local development.
- **Ease of Use**: Developers can use Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, or Terraform to set up and manage the entire local environment, allowing them to spin up services like SonarQube, ArgoCD, Vault, etc., quickly without manual configuration.
- **Scalability**: As new services are added to your environment (e.g., databases, caches, messaging systems), they can be added to this repository and maintained consistently.
- **Consistency**: It ensures that all developers are using the same configuration and setup scripts, reducing the risk of "it works on my machine" issues.

### 2. **Using Docker Compose for Local Development**

If you're not already using Kubernetes locally, you can use **Docker Compose** as a simpler alternative for setting up the necessary services locally. In this case, you would create a `docker-compose.yml` file to bring up services like SonarQube, Vault, and ArgoCD locally.

Example `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  sonarqube:
    image: sonarqube:latest
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    environment:
      - SONARQUBE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/sonar
      - SONARQUBE_JDBC_USERNAME=sonar
      - SONARQUBE_JDBC_PASSWORD=sonar

  vault:
    image: vault:latest
    ports:
      - "8200:8200"
    environment:
      - VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=root
    command: "server -dev"

  argocd:
    image: argoproj/argocd:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    command: "argocd-server"
```

#### Why?

- **Simple Local Setup**: Docker Compose is easier to use for local environments, and you don't need to set up Kubernetes or Terraform.
- **Quick Spin-up**: Services like SonarQube, Vault, and ArgoCD can be spun up quickly for local development and testing.
- **Easy Customization**: You can easily modify the Docker Compose file to add more services or change configurations as needed.

### 3. **Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

For services that require more complex setups or you prefer to maintain the infrastructure as code, you can use **Terraform** to provision infrastructure resources locally (or on a cloud provider if you wish to test with remote resources). This is particularly useful for cloud resources, such as databases, load balancers, or networking components.

You can have Terraform scripts to set up infrastructure like:

- SonarQube
- Vault
- ArgoCD
- Databases
- External services

Each Terraform script should be modular, for example:

- `sonarqube.tf`
- `vault.tf`
- `argocd.tf`

These can be version-controlled in the **infrastructure** repository.

#### Why?

- **Declarative Infrastructure**: Infrastructure is described as code, which makes it reproducible and maintainable.
- **Consistency**: Ensures the same environment configuration is deployed every time, whether locally or in the cloud.
- **Scalability**: Terraform can provision resources in both local and cloud environments, so your local setup can scale to a more production-like environment if needed.

### 4. **Helm for Kubernetes-based Setup (Optional)**

If you are using **Kubernetes** for local development (e.g., with MicroK8s), **Helm** charts are useful for packaging and deploying services like ArgoCD, Vault, or SonarQube. Helm simplifies the management of Kubernetes applications by providing templating and versioning of Kubernetes resources.

You can include Helm charts for services like:

- ArgoCD (`argo/argo-cd`)
- Vault (`vault/hashicorp-vault`)
- SonarQube (`sonarqube/sonarqube`)

#### Why?

- **Kubernetes-native**: If you're using MicroK8s locally, Helm helps you manage the Kubernetes-based deployments of your services.
- **Simplification**: Helm charts simplify Kubernetes application deployment, making it easier to manage resources, values, and configurations.

### 5. **Documentation and README Files**

Ensure your repository includes a comprehensive `README.md` to guide you and other developers through the setup, usage, and troubleshooting steps for these services in the local environment.

### Conclusion

For setting up services like **SonarQube**, **ArgoCD**, and **Vault** for local development, a dedicated **local-dev-environment** repository is ideal. This repository can contain:

- Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or Terraform configurations for deploying these services locally.
- Helm charts (if using Kubernetes).
- Automation scripts to deploy and configure the services.
- Shared configuration files.

By centralizing all of this infrastructure setup, you can easily replicate your local environment across different machines and ensure consistency across developers working on the project.
