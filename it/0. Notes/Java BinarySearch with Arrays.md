In Java, the `Arrays` class provides a `binarySearch` method that can be used to search for an element in a sorted array using the binary search algorithm. Here's an example of how to use the `binarySearch` method:

java

Copy code

`import java.util.Arrays;  public class BinarySearchExample {     public static void main(String[] args) {         // Example sorted array         int[] array = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 22, 25};          // Element to search for         int key = 15;          // Performing binary search         int index = Arrays.binarySearch(array, key);          // Check if the element was found         if (index >= 0) {             System.out.println("Element " + key + " found at index " + index);         } else {             System.out.println("Element " + key + " not found in the array");         }     } }`

It's important to note that the `binarySearch` method assumes that the array is sorted. If the array is not sorted, the result of the binary search may be incorrect.

If the array contains multiple occurrences of the search key, the `binarySearch` method may return any one of the indices associated with the key.

If the element is not found in the array, the method returns a negative value, which is the bitwise complement of the index where the element would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Remember to sort the array before using `binarySearch` if it's not already sorted. You can use the `Arrays.sort()` method for that.
