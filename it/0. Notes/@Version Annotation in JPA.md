Can you explain how works @version annotation from spring boot class statement

The `@Version` annotation in Spring Data JPA is used to implement optimistic locking in your database entities. Optimistic locking helps manage concurrent updates to the same data, ensuring that changes are applied in a consistent way without overwriting each other's updates.

Here's how it works:

1. **Define a Versioned Entity**: Add the `@Version` annotation to a field (usually an integer or timestamp) in your entity class. Every time an update is made to this entity, the version field is automatically incremented.
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `@Entity public class Product {     @Id     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)     private Long id;      private String name;      @Version     private Integer version;      // Getters and setters }`
    
2. **Behavior on Update**: When Spring Data JPA saves changes to this entity, it includes the current `version` value in the SQL `WHERE` clause. The SQL would look something like this:
    
    sql
    
    Copy code
    
    `UPDATE product SET name = ?, version = version + 1 WHERE id = ? AND version = ?`
    
    This means the update is applied only if the `version` field in the database matches the current `version` of the entity. If another transaction has updated the record in the meantime (and incremented the `version`), the `WHERE` clause fails to find a matching row, and no update is made.
    
3. **Optimistic Locking Exception**: If the `version` field in the database doesn’t match the current version (due to another transaction’s update), JPA throws an `OptimisticLockingFailureException`. You can catch this exception and handle it, perhaps by reloading the data, notifying the user of the concurrent update, or retrying the operation.
    
4. **Automatic Version Management**: You don’t need to manage the version field manually; Spring Data JPA takes care of incrementing it during updates.
    

The `@Version` annotation is particularly useful for systems with high concurrency, where multiple users may be editing the same records simultaneously.
