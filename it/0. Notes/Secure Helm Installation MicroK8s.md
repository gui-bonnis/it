To install Helm securely on your local MicroK8s cluster, you need to follow steps that ensure role-based access control (RBAC) and a proper setup for Helm Tiller (or Helm v3 if using that version, which doesn't require Tiller). Below are the steps for installing Helm with security in mind:

### 1. **Install Helm (Helm v3)**

Helm v3 does not require Tiller, making it simpler and more secure. Here’s how to install it:

1. Download the Helm binary:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash`
    
2. Verify the installation:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm version`
    

### 2. **Configure RBAC for Helm (Optional but recommended for v2)**

If you’re using Helm v2, you'll need to create proper role-based access control (RBAC) rules for the Tiller service. Since Helm v3 doesn’t use Tiller, you can skip this step.

### 3. **Create Helm Namespace**

Create a separate namespace for Helm-related deployments for better organization and security isolation:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl create namespace helm`

### 4. **Install Helm in MicroK8s**

You may need to enable the `helm3` addon in MicroK8s:

bash

Copy code

`microk8s enable helm3`

If `helm3` is not available as an addon, the manual installation will suffice as above.

### 5. **Secure Helm Charts**

When deploying Helm charts in your MicroK8s cluster, ensure that the chart values are secured (especially sensitive data like passwords or API keys). To do this:

- Use Kubernetes **Secrets** to store sensitive values.
- Avoid committing sensitive information to your `values.yaml` file.

Here’s an example to use secrets with Helm:

1. Create a secret:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=password=mysecurepassword -n helm`
    
2. Reference the secret in your Helm chart's `values.yaml`:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `secret:   password:      secretName: my-secret     secretKey: password`
    
3. Install the Helm chart with the secret:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm install my-app ./my-chart -n helm`
    

### 6. **Use TLS (Optional)**

To further secure Helm releases, you can enable TLS between Helm and your Kubernetes API. With Helm v3, this is less critical since it talks directly to the Kubernetes API server, and Tiller isn't required. However, if you're using v2 or handling sensitive applications, you may want to set up TLS.

### 7. **Manage Helm Repositories Securely**

When adding repositories, always use `https` for secure communication:

bash

Copy code

`helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable`

If you are hosting a private repository (e.g., using Gitea or another Git solution), ensure SSL certificates are properly configured for secure communications.

To host a private Helm chart repository using Gitea and ensure SSL certificates are properly configured, follow these detailed steps:

### 1. **Set up Gitea as a Helm Repository**

Gitea is a lightweight Git service that can host your private Helm charts. You’ll be storing your Helm charts in Gitea repositories, and each repository can act as a Helm chart repository by serving the chart files over HTTP/HTTPS.

#### Steps to Install Gitea on MicroK8s:

1. **Install Gitea using Helm** (since you're using MicroK8s, Helm can help):
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm repo add gitea https://dl.gitea.io/charts/ helm repo update helm install my-gitea gitea/gitea -n gitea --create-namespace`
    
    - This installs Gitea into your Kubernetes cluster within the `gitea` namespace.
    - Ensure that you specify proper `values.yaml` for storage and database configuration.
2. **Expose Gitea Service**:
    
    - By default, Gitea’s HTTP service is available on a ClusterIP. You’ll need to expose this service to the outside world, preferably using an **Ingress** to enforce SSL.
    
    For example:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `ingress:   enabled: true   hosts:     - host: gitea.local       paths:         - path: /           pathType: Prefix   tls:     - hosts:         - gitea.local       secretName: gitea-tls`
    
3. **Set Up Ingress Controller in MicroK8s**: Enable the **Ingress** controller:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable ingress`
    
    This step ensures your Gitea instance can be accessed via a domain (e.g., `gitea.local`).

### 2. **Configure SSL Certificates for Gitea**

To secure your Gitea instance with SSL certificates:

#### Option 1: Use Let's Encrypt (Recommended)

Let’s Encrypt provides free SSL certificates, and you can automate the process using **Cert-Manager**.

1. **Install Cert-Manager**: Enable Cert-Manager in MicroK8s:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable cert-manager`
    
2. **Create a ClusterIssuer for Let’s Encrypt**: You need to define a `ClusterIssuer` resource to request Let’s Encrypt certificates.
    
    For example, create a YAML file called `cluster-issuer.yaml`:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1 kind: ClusterIssuer metadata:   name: letsencrypt-prod spec:   acme:     server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory     email: your-email@example.com     privateKeySecretRef:       name: letsencrypt-prod     solvers:     - http01:         ingress:           class: nginx`
    
    Apply the issuer:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl apply -f cluster-issuer.yaml`
    
3. **Request SSL Certificates for Gitea**: Update the Gitea Ingress configuration to request certificates using Cert-Manager:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `ingress:   enabled: true   annotations:     cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"   hosts:     - host: gitea.local       paths:         - path: /           pathType: Prefix   tls:     - hosts:         - gitea.local       secretName: gitea-tls`
    
    Apply the changes:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm upgrade my-gitea gitea/gitea -f values.yaml -n gitea`
    

Cert-Manager will automatically issue a certificate and update the Gitea Ingress with the SSL configuration. Your Gitea instance should now be accessible over HTTPS using a valid certificate from Let’s Encrypt.

#### Option 2: Use Self-Signed Certificates

If you don’t want to use Let’s Encrypt or are in a closed environment, you can generate a self-signed SSL certificate.

1. **Generate a Self-Signed Certificate**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout gitea.key -out gitea.crt -subj "/CN=gitea.local/O=MyCompany"`
    
2. **Create a Kubernetes Secret**: Store the generated certificates in Kubernetes:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl create secret tls gitea-tls --key gitea.key --cert gitea.crt -n gitea`
    
3. **Update Gitea Ingress to Use the Self-Signed Certificate**: Modify the Gitea Ingress configuration to reference the self-signed certificate:
    
    yaml
    
    Copy code
    
    `ingress:   enabled: true   hosts:     - host: gitea.local       paths:         - path: /           pathType: Prefix   tls:     - hosts:         - gitea.local       secretName: gitea-tls`
    
4. **Update your local `/etc/hosts` file**: Ensure `gitea.local` resolves to your MicroK8s cluster’s IP address by adding it to `/etc/hosts`:
    
    lua
    
    Copy code
    
    `127.0.0.1 gitea.local`
    
    This step ensures that you can access Gitea using the domain `gitea.local`.

### 3. **Host Helm Charts in Gitea**

Now that Gitea is running with SSL:

1. **Create a Repository for Helm Charts**: In Gitea, create a new repository where you will store Helm charts (e.g., `helm-charts`).
    
2. **Package Your Helm Chart**: Package your Helm chart using Helm’s `package` command:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm package mychart/`
    
    This generates a `.tgz` file.
    
3. **Upload the Chart to Gitea**: Commit and push the Helm chart `.tgz` file to the newly created Gitea repository.
    
4. **Generate an `index.yaml` File**: To make the repository a valid Helm repository, you need an `index.yaml` file:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm repo index . --url https://gitea.local/gitea-username/helm-charts/raw/branch-name/`
    
    Commit and push the `index.yaml` file to the same Gitea repository.
    

---

### 4. **Access the Private Helm Repository**

1. **Add the Gitea Helm Repository**: In your local Helm configuration, add the Gitea repository:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm repo add my-private-repo https://gitea.local/gitea-username/helm-charts/raw/branch-name/`
    
2. **Access the Private Repository with HTTPS**: Since you have secured Gitea with SSL, make sure your Helm client can properly access the HTTPS-enabled repo. If using a self-signed certificate, you may need to configure your Helm client to trust the self-signed certificate.
    
    For Let's Encrypt, Helm should work out of the box with the valid certificate.
    
3. **Install Charts from Gitea**: Install a chart from your private repository:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm install my-app my-private-repo/mychart`
    

---

### 5. **Enhance Security with Authentication**

To further secure your Gitea Helm repository, you can enable authentication in Gitea:

1. **Enable Basic Auth**: Gitea supports basic HTTP authentication. You can add an additional layer of security by requiring a username and password when pulling charts.
    
2. **Configure Helm for Authentication**: Helm supports passing credentials:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm repo add my-private-repo https://gitea.local/gitea-username/helm-charts/raw/branch-name/ --username myuser --password mypassword`
    

---

By following these steps, you ensure that Gitea is securely hosting your private Helm charts with SSL, protecting the communication with your private repository.
