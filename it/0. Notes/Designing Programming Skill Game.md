Interesting choice! REST (Representational State Transfer) isn't exactly a programming language but rather an architectural style for designing networked applications. However, we can certainly create a game concept that involves learning about REST principles and how they apply to programming.

How would you like the game to be structured? Would it be a simulation-style game, a puzzle-solving game, or perhaps something else?
