    - Profiling and optimizing Java applications.
    - Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.
18. **Security Best Practices:**
    
    - Understanding of common security vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them (e.g., OWASP Top Ten).
19. **Debugging and Troubleshooting:**
    
    - Proficient in debugging tools and techniques.
    - Troubleshooting production issues effectively.
20. **Code Quality and Code Review:**

In addition to technical knowledge, a Senior Java Developer should also possess strong problem-solving skills, good communication skills, and the ability to work collaboratively in a team. Interviewers may also assess soft skills, such as your ability to explain technical concepts, work under pressure, and adapt to changing requirements. Be prepared to provide examples from your past experiences that demonstrate your expertise in these areas.
