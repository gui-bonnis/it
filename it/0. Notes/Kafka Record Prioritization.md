There is any feature at kafka that prioritize any record consumption over topic insert order?

By default, Kafka processes records in the order they are inserted into a topic partition. However, if you want to prioritize certain records over others, you would need to implement custom logic, as Kafka does not natively support prioritization outside of partitioning and ordering.

### Strategies to Prioritize Records in Kafka:

1. **Topic Segmentation by Priority:**
    
    - Create separate topics for different priorities (e.g., `high-priority`, `low-priority`).
    - Producers decide which topic to publish to based on priority.
    - Consumers can first consume from `high-priority` topics and then process lower-priority ones.
2. **Message Headers for Priority:**
    
    - Add a priority flag in the Kafka message headers or payload.
    - Implement custom consumer logic to prioritize messages with a higher priority.
    - This requires a mechanism to buffer and sort records at the consumer level since Kafka itself does not reorder messages within a partition.
3. **Partitioning by Priority:**
    
    - Use a custom partitioning strategy to direct high-priority messages to specific partitions.
    - Consumers can process high-priority partitions first.
4. **Dynamic Partition Reassignment:**
    
    - Designate specific partitions for high-priority messages temporarily.
    - Dynamically adjust which partitions handle high-priority messages as needed.
    - Requires a mechanism to handle reassignment.
5. **Real-Time Priority Shifting:**
    
    - Use a secondary system or queue to re-prioritize messages outside of Kafka (e.g., Redis or in-memory priority queues).
    - Consume from Kafka and push high-priority messages to the secondary system for immediate processing.
6. **Consumer Group Priority:**
    
    - Use multiple consumer groups with different processing priorities.
    - Consumer groups designated for high-priority processing can consume and process specific partitions or topics first.

### Considerations:

- **Complexity:** Implementing prioritization requires additional components or logic, as it deviates from Kafka's default processing guarantees.
- **Performance:** Sorting or buffering records to prioritize them can introduce latency.
- **Message Order:** Prioritization may disrupt Kafka’s guarantee of order within partitions.
- **Scalability:** Managing priorities across a large number of records or topics may require additional system resources.

If prioritization is crucial for your use case, carefully evaluate the trade-offs and consider whether additional tools like **Kafka Streams**, **Flink**, or an external message broker with built-in prioritization (e.g., RabbitMQ) might better suit your requirements.

##### You said:

My scenario is, I have a high load from historical data that is processing the whole day and some events that came from an online platform. I need to prioritize the online events over the heavy load.

In your scenario, prioritizing online events over historical data processing is a common challenge. Here's a practical approach using Kafka, combining strategies for prioritization:

### **Solution Overview**

1. **Separate Topics for Priority Levels:**
    
    - **`online-events` topic:** For real-time events from the online platform.
    - **`historical-data` topic:** For batch processing of historical data.
    
    This separation allows independent processing flows and ensures online events are not delayed by historical data.
    
2. **Prioritized Consumption Logic:**
    
    - Consumers should always process records from the `online-events` topic first.
    - If the `online-events` topic is empty, the consumer can fall back to consuming records from the `historical-data` topic.

---

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Set Up Topics**

- Create two topics:
    
    ```shell
    kafka-topics --create --topic online-events --partitions 3 --replication-factor 3 --bootstrap-server <broker-address>
    kafka-topics --create --topic historical-data --partitions 3 --replication-factor 3 --bootstrap-server <broker-address>
    ```
    

#### **2. Configure Producers**

- Route events to the appropriate topics:
    - Online platform events → `online-events`
    - Historical batch data → `historical-data`

#### **3. Implement a Prioritized Consumer**

- Use a consumer application that prioritizes the `online-events` topic.

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;

import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Properties;

public class PrioritizedConsumer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put("bootstrap.servers", "localhost:9092");
        props.put("group.id", "priority-consumer-group");
        props.put("key.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");
        props.put("value.deserializer", "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer");

        KafkaConsumer<String, String> onlineConsumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
        KafkaConsumer<String, String> historicalConsumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);

        onlineConsumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("online-events"));
        historicalConsumer.subscribe(Arrays.asList("historical-data"));

        while (true) {
            // Poll online events first
            ConsumerRecords<String, String> onlineRecords = onlineConsumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
            if (!onlineRecords.isEmpty()) {
                onlineRecords.forEach(record -> {
                    // Process online events
                    System.out.printf("Processing online event: key=%s, value=%s%n", record.key(), record.value());
                });
            } else {
                // Fall back to historical data
                ConsumerRecords<String, String> historicalRecords = historicalConsumer.poll(Duration.ofMillis(100));
                historicalRecords.forEach(record -> {
                    // Process historical data
                    System.out.printf("Processing historical data: key=%s, value=%s%n", record.key(), record.value());
                });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **Optimizations**

1. **Consumer Group Assignment:**
    
    - Dedicate consumer groups for each topic.
    - Example:
        - `online-consumer-group` processes only `online-events`.
        - `historical-consumer-group` processes `historical-data` but only when system load is low.
2. **Dynamic Rate Limiting:**
    
    - Use metrics like lag and system load to dynamically adjust the rate at which historical data is consumed.
    - Example: If lag in `online-events` exceeds a threshold, pause `historical-data` consumption.
3. **Leverage Kafka QoS Features:**
    
    - **Message Timeouts:** Set shorter timeouts for `online-events` consumers to ensure faster retries.
    - **Message Expiration:** Use TTL (Time-to-Live) for historical data to prioritize freshness.

### **Trade-Offs and Considerations**

1. **Processing Order:**
    
    - Separate topics might mean losing strict global order if inter-event dependency exists.
2. **Backpressure Management:**
    
    - Ensure consumers can handle spikes in online events without overwhelming resources.
3. **Monitoring and Scaling:**
    
    - Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track consumer lags and adjust processing capacity dynamically.

This design ensures online events are processed with minimal latency while maintaining historical data processing throughput.
