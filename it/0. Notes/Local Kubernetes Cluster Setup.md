### Plan for Setting Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster (MicroK8s) for Spring Boot Microservices Development

#### **1. Environment Setup**

- **OS:** Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution)
- **Kubernetes Distribution:** MicroK8s
- **Cluster Type:** Single-node for local development
- **Memory/Storage:** At least 14 GB RAM and 500 GB HDD (as per your system specs)

#### **2. Install MicroK8s**

- **Install MicroK8s**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo snap install microk8s --classic`
    
- **Add user to the MicroK8s group**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube newgrp microk8s`
    
- **Enable essential add-ons**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable dns storage ingress metallb:192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250`
    

#### **3. Networking Setup**

- **Ingress Controller**: Enable the NGINX ingress controller to expose Spring Boot services.
- **DNS Setup**: Use MetalLB to provide load balancing services. Optionally, configure a local DNS service for development purposes.
- **Certificate Management**: Integrate **Cert-Manager** for handling certificates, especially if you plan to use HTTPS for services.
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable cert-manager`
    

#### **4. CI/CD and GitOps Tools**

- **Gitea for Git**: Set up Gitea as a self-hosted Git service for source control.
- **ArgoCD or FluxCD for GitOps**: Enable GitOps to automate deployments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Use Jenkins or GitLab for CI. Ensure pipelines can build, test, and deploy Spring Boot microservices to your MicroK8s cluster.

#### **5. Spring Boot Microservices Development**

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Deploy PostgreSQL in the cluster, secured with Kubernetes Secrets, and accessible outside the cluster.
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable helm3 helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm install postgres bitnami/postgresql --namespace local-dev`
    
- **Cache Layer**: Implement Redis as a cache service. It can be deployed using Helm:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `helm install redis bitnami/redis --namespace local-dev`
    

#### **6. Service Observability and Monitoring**

- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Enable Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring your Spring Boot services.
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s enable prometheus microk8s enable grafana`
    
- **ELK Stack (or EFK Stack)**: Set up ElasticSearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (or Loki for logs). You can use **Fluentd** to collect logs from Spring Boot microservices and view them in Kibana.

#### **7. Storage and Persistence**

- **Persistent Volume (PV)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**: Use the default MicroK8s host-path storage class or install **NFS** for better scalability.
- **Database Backups**: Use Velero or a custom backup strategy for PostgreSQL backups.

#### **8. Security**

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Implement RBAC policies to secure access to Kubernetes resources.
- **Secrets Management**: Use Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive data such as API keys, credentials, etc.
- **Network Policies**: Define network policies to control the traffic flow between services.

#### **9. Scaling and Testing**

- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Configure HPA for auto-scaling Spring Boot microservices based on CPU/memory.
- **Load Testing**: Use tools like **Apache JMeter** or **K6** to simulate load and test the microservices.

#### **10. Local Dev Experience**

- **Telepresence or Tilt**: Use tools like Telepresence or Tilt to develop Spring Boot microservices locally while connected to the Kubernetes cluster.
- **IDE Integration**: Use IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code with Kubernetes plugins for better development experience.

#### **11. Backup & Restore**

- **Velero**: Install Velero for backing up and restoring your Kubernetes cluster resources.
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `velero install --provider <your-choice> --bucket <your-bucket>`
    

### **Next Steps**

1. **Set up the basic infrastructure**: MicroK8s, networking, and storage.
2. **Deploy PostgreSQL and Redis** for your microservices.
3. **Set up CI/CD** with GitOps (Gitea, ArgoCD, etc.).
4. **Enable observability** (Prometheus, Grafana, and logs).
5. **Test your Spring Boot microservices** on the cluster.

Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any part!

### Step 1: Set up the Basic Infrastructure — MicroK8s, Networking, and Storage

#### **1.1 Install MicroK8s**

Follow these steps to install and configure MicroK8s on your local machine.

1. **Install MicroK8s**:
    
    - Run the following command to install MicroK8s:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo snap install microk8s --classic`
        
2. **Add the current user to the MicroK8s group**:
    
    - This will give your user access to MicroK8s without needing `sudo` for every command:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube newgrp microk8s`
        
3. **Check MicroK8s status**:
    
    - Ensure everything is running properly:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `microk8s status --wait-ready`
        

#### **1.2 Configure Networking**

You'll need to configure DNS and ingress so your services are accessible within your cluster and externally.

1. **Enable DNS**:
    
    - DNS is required for service discovery in Kubernetes:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `microk8s enable dns`
        
2. **Enable Ingress**:
    
    - Ingress is used to route external traffic to your Spring Boot microservices. Enabling NGINX Ingress Controller will allow you to expose services using HTTP/HTTPS routes.
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `microk8s enable ingress`
        
3. **Configure MetalLB for Load Balancing**:
    
    - MetalLB allows you to assign an external IP range to services of type `LoadBalancer`. This is useful for routing traffic to your applications.
    - Replace `192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250` with an IP range within your network:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `microk8s enable metallb:192.168.1.240-192.168.1.250`
        
4. **Configure Ingress with a Custom Domain**:
    
    - If you're planning to set up a local DNS, configure a custom domain using `/etc/hosts` or a DNS service. For instance, you could map `microservice.local` to the Ingress IP.
    - Example: Add to `/etc/hosts`
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `192.168.1.240  microservice.local`
        

#### **1.3 Set Up Storage**

For persistent data (e.g., databases, file storage), you need a storage solution. MicroK8s includes a default `hostPath` storage class, but for scalability, consider using NFS or another storage backend.

1. **Enable the default storage class**:
    
    - MicroK8s comes with a default storage class that uses `hostPath` on the local disk. You can enable it as follows:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `microk8s enable storage`
        
2. **Validate storage is enabled**:
    
    - Check the storage class:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `kubectl get storageclass`
        
    - You should see something like:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `NAME             PROVISIONER                RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE microk8s-hostpath  microk8s.io/hostpath      Delete          Immediate`
        
3. **(Optional) Set up NFS for scalable storage**:
    
    - You can configure NFS if you prefer an external network storage solution. Here’s an example of setting up NFS:
        - First, install NFS server on your host:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server`
            
        - Create a shared directory:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `sudo mkdir /srv/nfs/kubedata sudo chown nobody:nogroup /srv/nfs/kubedata`
            
        - Edit `/etc/exports` and add the following line:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `/srv/nfs/kubedata *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)`
            
        - Apply the changes:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `sudo exportfs -ra`
            
        - Deploy an NFS provisioner in MicroK8s. You can use Helm:
            
            bash
            
            Copy code
            
            `helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable helm install nfs-provisioner stable/nfs-client-provisioner --set nfs.server=<your-nfs-server-ip> --set nfs.path=/srv/nfs/kubedata`
            

#### **1.4 Verify Everything is Working**

1. **Check your services**:
    
    - Run the following to ensure all the MicroK8s services are running correctly:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `microk8s status --wait-ready`
        
2. **Verify the Ingress Controller**:
    
    - Create a sample Ingress resource to verify it is routing requests correctly.
        
        yaml
        
        Copy code
        
        `apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: example-ingress   annotations:     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: / spec:   rules:   - host: microservice.local     http:       paths:       - path: /         pathType: Prefix         backend:           service:             name: <your-service-name>             port:               number: 80`
        
    - After deploying this Ingress resource, try accessing `http://microservice.local` from your browser.
3. **Verify Storage**:
    
    - Deploy a sample pod that uses a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to test your storage setup:
        
        yaml
        
        Copy code
        
        `apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata:   name: test-pvc spec:   accessModes:   - ReadWriteOnce   resources:     requests:       storage: 1Gi --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata:   name: test-pod spec:   containers:   - name: test-container     image: busybox     command: [ "sleep", "3600" ]     volumeMounts:     - mountPath: "/data"       name: test-volume   volumes:   - name: test-volume     persistentVolumeClaim:       claimName: test-pvc`
        
    - Once the pod is running, you can check if the PVC has been correctly bound by running:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `kubectl get pvc`
        

#### **1.5 Clean Up (Optional)**

- If you need to disable or clean up specific resources:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s disable dns storage ingress metallb`

How can I get the IP range of my network (ubuntu)

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To get the IP range of your local network on Ubuntu, you can use a combination of network tools like `ip` or `ifconfig`, along with `netmask` to determine the range.

### 1. Using `ip` Command

1. Open your terminal.
    
2. Run the following command to get your network interface details:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `ip addr show`
    
3. Look for the network interface you're using (typically `eth0` or `wlan0` for wired or wireless networks respectively). The output will show something like this:
    
    sql
    
    Copy code
    
    `3: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000     inet 192.168.1.10/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic eth0        valid_lft 86345sec preferred_lft 86345sec`
    
4. From the `inet` line, you can see:
    
    - **IP Address**: `192.168.1.10`
    - **Netmask** (CIDR notation): `/24`

### 2. Using `ifconfig`

Alternatively, you can use the `ifconfig` command:

1. Install `net-tools` (if not installed):
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo apt install net-tools`
    
2. Run:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `ifconfig`
    
3. Look for your network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`), and find the IP and netmask. Example output:
    
    Copy code
    
    `inet addr:192.168.1.10  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0`
    

### 3. Calculate the IP Range

Now that you have the IP address and the netmask, you can calculate the range:

- **IP Address**: `192.168.1.10`
- **Netmask**: `255.255.255.0` (which is `/24` in CIDR notation)

#### CIDR Breakdown

For a `/24` subnet, the range will be:

- **Network Address**: `192.168.1.0`
- **Broadcast Address**: `192.168.1.255`
- **Usable IP Range**: `192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254`

### **Automated Method:**

To calculate the network range using a tool:

bash

Copy code

`ipcalc 192.168.1.10/24`

This will give you the network range and other details like netmask, broadcast address, and more.

Let me know if you need help interpreting the results!

how can I verify the Ingress Controller and Storage. I don't have any thing yet

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To verify the Ingress Controller and Storage in your **MicroK8s** cluster, you can deploy simple test resources like a **dummy service for Ingress** and a **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** for storage, even if you don't have any applications yet. Here's how you can test both:

---

### **1. Verifying the Ingress Controller**

You can create a simple `nginx` service and expose it through the Ingress Controller.

#### **Step 1: Create a Dummy Deployment**

Deploy a simple `nginx` container in your cluster.

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: nginx-deployment spec:   replicas: 1   selector:     matchLabels:       app: nginx   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: nginx     spec:       containers:       - name: nginx         image: nginx         ports:         - containerPort: 80 EOF`

#### **Step 2: Create a Service for the Deployment**

Expose this deployment with a Kubernetes `Service`.

bash

Copy code

`kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=nginx-service`

This will create a `ClusterIP` service, which is only accessible from within the cluster.

#### **Step 3: Create an Ingress Resource**

Now, create an Ingress resource to expose the `nginx-service` to the outside world. Replace `microservice.local` with any domain or local IP you want to use for testing.

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: nginx-ingress   annotations:     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: / spec:   rules:   - host: microservice.local     http:       paths:       - path: /         pathType: Prefix         backend:           service:             name: nginx-service             port:               number: 80 EOF`

#### **Step 4: Test the Ingress**

1. **Modify `/etc/hosts`** (on your local machine):
    
    - Map the domain `microservice.local` to the IP of your MicroK8s Ingress Controller. You can find this IP by running:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `kubectl get svc -A | grep ingress`
        
        For example, if you find the IP to be `192.168.1.240`, then add this to `/etc/hosts`:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
        
        Add:
        
        lua
        
        Copy code
        
        `192.168.1.240  microservice.local`
        
2. **Access the service**:
    
    - Open a browser or use `curl` to check if you can access the service via the Ingress:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `curl http://microservice.local`
        
    - You should see the default **nginx** welcome page if the Ingress Controller is working correctly.

---

### **2. Verifying the Storage**

You can create a simple pod that uses a **PersistentVolumeClaim** (PVC) to verify if your storage is correctly set up.

#### **Step 1: Create a PersistentVolumeClaim**

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata:   name: test-pvc spec:   accessModes:   - ReadWriteOnce   resources:     requests:       storage: 1Gi EOF`

This creates a PVC that requests `1Gi` of storage from the default `microk8s-hostpath` storage class.

#### **Step 2: Create a Test Pod Using the PVC**

Now, create a pod that mounts this PVC and writes data to the volume.

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata:   name: test-pod spec:   containers:   - name: busybox     image: busybox     command: ["sh", "-c", "echo 'Hello from PVC' > /data/testfile && sleep 3600"]     volumeMounts:     - name: test-storage       mountPath: /data   volumes:   - name: test-storage     persistentVolumeClaim:       claimName: test-pvc EOF`

#### **Step 3: Verify the Storage**

1. **Check the status of the PVC**:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get pvc`
    
    You should see the PVC bound to a PersistentVolume:
    
    objectivec
    
    Copy code
    
    `NAME       STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS      AGE test-pvc   Bound    pvc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx   1Gi        RWO            microk8s-hostpath 1m`
    
2. **Verify the Pod**:
    
    - Check that the pod is running:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `kubectl get pods`
        
3. **Inspect the Pod to Verify File Creation**:
    
    - If the pod is running, you can `exec` into the pod to verify that the file was written to the PVC:
        
        bash
        
        Copy code
        
        `kubectl exec -it test-pod -- cat /data/testfile`
        
    - The output should be:
        
        csharp
        
        Copy code
        
        `Hello from PVC`
        

---

### **Clean Up (Optional)**

If you'd like to clean up the resources after testing:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment kubectl delete service nginx-service kubectl delete ingress nginx-ingress kubectl delete pvc test-pvc kubectl delete pod test-pod`

---

This should allow you to verify that both your Ingress Controller and storage are working as expected in your **MicroK8s** cluster. Let me know if you need further assistance!

If you are unable to find the **Ingress Controller** service with `kubectl get svc -A | grep ingress`, it's possible that the Ingress Controller hasn't been enabled in your **MicroK8s** setup. In **MicroK8s**, the Ingress Controller is disabled by default and needs to be enabled manually.

### **Step-by-Step: Enable and Verify the Ingress Controller**

#### **1. Enable the Ingress Controller in MicroK8s**

Run the following command to enable the Ingress Controller:

bash

Copy code

`microk8s enable ingress`

This will install NGINX as the default Ingress Controller in your cluster.

#### **2. Check the Ingress Controller Service**

After enabling, run the following command to check if the Ingress Controller service is running:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -A | grep ingress`

You should see something similar to:

scss

Copy code

`NAMESPACE            NAME                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE ingress              ingress-nginx          LoadBalancer   10.152.183.132   <pending>     80:31214/TCP,443:31666/TCP    2m`

This indicates the NGINX Ingress Controller is running and has an internal `ClusterIP` or `LoadBalancer` IP.

#### **3. Verify the Ingress Controller IP**

If it's a **LoadBalancer** service, the `EXTERNAL-IP` field will be used to expose the Ingress Controller.

If you get `<pending>` in the `EXTERNAL-IP` field, it might be because **MicroK8s** doesn’t automatically assign external IP addresses to services of type `LoadBalancer` in a local development environment.

In this case, you can still test using the **NodePort** by finding the node IP of your MicroK8s and using the port assigned in the Ingress Controller service.

1. Find your node IP:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s kubectl get nodes -o wide`
    
    Look for the `INTERNAL-IP` or `EXTERNAL-IP` of your node, for example `192.168.1.100`.
    
2. Use the `NodePort` to access the Ingress. In the example, the port would be `31214` for HTTP (port `80`).
    
    So the service can be accessed via:
    
    arduino
    
    Copy code
    
    `http://192.168.1.100:31214`
    

#### **4. Testing with a Simple NGINX Deployment**

After the Ingress Controller is enabled, you can follow the earlier steps I mentioned to deploy a test service and create an Ingress resource.

---

### **If Ingress Is Still Not Working**

If you still don't see the Ingress Controller or it isn't working:

1. **Check MicroK8s Addons Status**: Ensure that the Ingress addon is listed and enabled:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s status --wait-ready`
    
    You should see `ingress` in the enabled section.
    
2. **Restart MicroK8s**: Sometimes, restarting MicroK8s can resolve the issue:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s stop microk8s start`
    
3. **Check Logs for Issues**: Check the logs of the Ingress controller if it's enabled but not working properly:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl logs -n ingress <ingress-controller-pod-name>`
    
    You can get the pod name by running:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get pods -n ingress`
    

Let me know if you need further assistance!

Based on the output of `microk8s kubectl get nodes -o wide`, your node's **internal IP** is `192.168.15.12`. Since the **Ingress Controller** may not have an external IP assigned, you can access services using this internal node IP with the **NodePort** assigned to the Ingress Controller.

### Next Steps to Verify Ingress:

#### **1. Check the Ingress Controller Service**

After enabling the Ingress Controller (`microk8s enable ingress`), check if it has been assigned a `NodePort`:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

You should see an output like:

scss

Copy code

`NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE ingress-nginx   LoadBalancer   10.152.183.50   <pending>     80:32000/TCP,443:32001/TCP   10m`

If you see `80:32000/TCP` for HTTP and `443:32001/TCP` for HTTPS, it means the Ingress Controller is accessible via **NodePort**.

#### **2. Access the Ingress via NodePort**

Since your node's **INTERNAL IP** is `192.168.15.12`, you can use this IP along with the NodePort to access the services.

For example, if `80` is mapped to `32000`, use:

bash

Copy code

`http://192.168.15.12:32000`

You can also verify by using `curl`:

bash

Copy code

`curl http://192.168.15.12:32000`

#### **3. Create a Test Ingress Resource (if not done already)**

If you haven't created a test Ingress resource, you can follow the earlier steps to expose a simple service like `nginx`. Here's a brief reminder:

1. Deploy an `nginx` application and expose it with a service:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=nginx-service`
    
2. Create an Ingress resource to route traffic to the `nginx` service:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: nginx-ingress   annotations:     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: / spec:   rules:   - host: nginx.local     http:       paths:       - path: /         pathType: Prefix         backend:           service:             name: nginx-service             port:               number: 80 EOF`
    
3. Modify your `/etc/hosts` to route `nginx.local` to your internal IP:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
    
    Add this line:
    
    lua
    
    Copy code
    
    `192.168.15.12  nginx.local`
    
4. Test in the browser or with `curl`:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `curl http://nginx.local`
    

You should see the default **nginx** welcome page if everything is working correctly.

---

### Troubleshooting Tips:

- Ensure the Ingress Controller is running by checking the status:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `microk8s status --wait-ready`
    
    Look for `ingress` to be listed as enabled.
    
- If you encounter any issues, check the logs for the Ingress Controller:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl logs -n ingress $(kubectl get pods -n ingress -o name)`
    

Let me know if this helps or if you need further clarification!

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The message "No resources found in ingress namespace" means that the Ingress Controller is either not enabled or not properly deployed in your **MicroK8s** cluster. Let's troubleshoot and make sure the Ingress Controller is set up correctly.

### **Step 1: Ensure the Ingress Addon is Enabled**

Run the following command to enable the Ingress controller:

bash

Copy code

`microk8s enable ingress`

After enabling it, you should see a message that indicates the Ingress controller has been deployed.

### **Step 2: Check the Status of MicroK8s Addons**

Verify the status of your MicroK8s addons to ensure that the Ingress addon is enabled:

bash

Copy code

`microk8s status --wait-ready`

You should see `ingress` listed under **enabled addons**. If it's not listed as enabled, repeat the `microk8s enable ingress` command.

### **Step 3: Check Ingress Controller Resources**

Once the addon is enabled, check if the Ingress resources are present:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get all -n ingress`

This should list the Ingress controller pod and service. You should see something like:

bash

Copy code

`NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE pod/nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller-xxxxx      1/1     Running   0          2m  NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE service/ingress-nginx   LoadBalancer   10.152.183.132   <pending>     80:32000/TCP,443:32001/TCP   2m`

### **Step 4: Check the Logs for Issues**

If the Ingress controller pod isn’t running or not listed, check the logs to see if there are any issues:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl logs -n ingress $(kubectl get pods -n ingress -o name)`

This should provide some insights into what's going wrong if there are any errors.

### **Step 5: Access the Ingress Controller**

If the Ingress Controller is now running and the service is available with a NodePort, you should be able to access it via your node's internal IP (`192.168.15.12`).

For example:

bash

Copy code

`http://192.168.15.12:32000`

You can verify that the Ingress is functioning by creating a test `nginx` deployment and exposing it as I described in earlier steps.

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

It looks like the **NGINX Ingress Controller** is running successfully based on the output of `kubectl get all -n ingress`. However, you don’t see a service for the Ingress controller, which means we need to verify the service configuration to expose it properly.

### **Step-by-Step to Expose and Verify the Ingress Controller:**

#### **1. Check if the Service for the Ingress Controller Exists**

Run the following command to list all services in the `ingress` namespace:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

If no service is found, it means the service wasn’t created. You can create one manually to expose the Ingress Controller.

#### **2. Create a Service for the Ingress Controller (if it’s missing)**

If there is no service or it’s not configured correctly, you can create a service of type `NodePort` to expose the Ingress Controller. Here's how:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: nginx-ingress   namespace: ingress spec:   type: NodePort   ports:     - port: 80       targetPort: 80       nodePort: 32000     - port: 443       targetPort: 443       nodePort: 32001   selector:     name: nginx-ingress-microk8s EOF`

This service will expose HTTP on `port 32000` and HTTPS on `port 32001`.

#### **3. Verify the Ingress Controller Service**

After creating the service, verify it’s running by checking the services again:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

You should see output like:

scss

Copy code

`NAME            TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE nginx-ingress   NodePort   10.152.183.50    <none>        80:32000/TCP, 443:32001/TCP  2m`

#### **4. Access the Ingress Controller**

Now, you can access the Ingress Controller using your node’s internal IP and the assigned **NodePort**:

- For HTTP: `http://192.168.15.12:32000`
- For HTTPS: `https://192.168.15.12:32001`

#### **5. Test with an NGINX Deployment**

If you haven’t already, you can deploy a test `nginx` service and create an Ingress resource as mentioned earlier to verify the Ingress functionality.

##### You said:

The Service "nginx-ingress" is invalid: spec.ports[0].nodePort: Invalid value: 32000: provided port is already allocated

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The error indicates that the `NodePort` you specified (`32000`) is already in use by another service in your cluster. Kubernetes automatically allocates a NodePort from a range (default 30000–32767), so we can let Kubernetes choose the port or use a different one manually.

Here’s how you can adjust the service to either auto-allocate a port or specify a different one:

### **Option 1: Let Kubernetes Auto-Assign NodePort**

If you don't need specific ports like `32000` or `32001`, you can let Kubernetes assign random ports from its NodePort range:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: nginx-ingress   namespace: ingress spec:   type: NodePort   ports:     - port: 80       targetPort: 80     - port: 443       targetPort: 443   selector:     name: nginx-ingress-microk8s EOF`

This will automatically assign free ports, which you can verify by running:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

Look for the `NodePort` value under the `PORT(S)` column, e.g., `80:32011/TCP, 443:32012/TCP`.

### **Option 2: Specify Different NodePorts Manually**

If you prefer to specify custom ports, choose unused ones in the NodePort range (30000–32767). For example:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: nginx-ingress   namespace: ingress spec:   type: NodePort   ports:     - port: 80       targetPort: 80       nodePort: 32010  # Specify a different NodePort     - port: 443       targetPort: 443       nodePort: 32011  # Specify a different NodePort   selector:     name: nginx-ingress-microk8s EOF`

Then verify again:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

You should now see the assigned NodePorts, such as `80:32010/TCP` and `443:32011/TCP`.

### **Access the Ingress Controller**

After the service is created, use the **internal IP** of your node (`192.168.15.12`) along with the assigned NodePort:

- HTTP: `http://192.168.15.12:<assigned-http-port>`
- HTTPS: `https://192.168.15.12:<assigned-https-port>`

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

It looks like you successfully enabled the Ingress addon for your MicroK8s cluster! This means the Ingress controller is set up to manage traffic routing.

### **Next Steps: Verify and Access the Ingress Controller**

#### **1. Check the Ingress Controller**

Run the following command to see if the Ingress controller is running and available:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get pods -n ingress`

You should see a pod with a name like `nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller-xxxxx` in the **Running** state.

#### **2. Check Services for the Ingress Controller**

Next, check for the services created in the `ingress` namespace:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

Look for a service named `nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller`. If it's not visible, you may need to create one to expose the Ingress controller.

### **3. Creating the Service if Missing**

If the service is not created automatically, you can create it manually. Here’s an example service configuration for the Ingress controller:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller   namespace: ingress spec:   type: NodePort   ports:     - port: 80       targetPort: 80     - port: 443       targetPort: 443   selector:     app: nginx-ingress-microk8s EOF`

### **4. Verify the Service**

After applying the above YAML, run the command again to check the services:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

You should now see the `nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller` service listed, along with its `NodePort` assignments.

### **5. Access the Ingress Controller**

Use the internal IP of your MicroK8s node (`192.168.15.12`) and the NodePort to access the Ingress:

- For HTTP: `http://192.168.15.12:<NodePort>`
- For HTTPS: `https://192.168.15.12:<NodePort>`

### **6. Create an Ingress Resource (Optional)**

You can create an Ingress resource to route traffic to specific services. Here's a simple example to create an Ingress for an NGINX deployment:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f - <<EOF apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: example-ingress   namespace: default spec:   rules:   - host: example.local     http:       paths:       - path: /         pathType: Prefix         backend:           service:             name: your-service-name             port:               number: 80 EOF`

Make sure to replace `your-service-name` with the actual name of your service.

### **7. Update Your `/etc/hosts` (if needed)**

If you created an Ingress resource with a hostname (like `example.local`), you can test it by adding an entry to your local `/etc/hosts` file:

lua

Copy code

`192.168.15.12 example.local`

Now you can access your service via `http://example.local`.

The error message indicates that the `Service` definition for the Ingress controller requires names for the ports. When defining a service in Kubernetes, each port should have a `name` field.

Here’s how to modify your service definition to include port names:

### **Service Definition with Port Names**

Update your `teste_ingress_service.yaml` file to include names for each port. Here’s an example:

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller   namespace: ingress spec:   type: NodePort   ports:     - name: http       port: 80       targetPort: 80       nodePort: 32000  # Optionally specify a NodePort     - name: https       port: 443       targetPort: 443       nodePort: 32001  # Optionally specify a NodePort   selector:     app: nginx-ingress-microk8s`

### **Applying the Service Configuration**

After saving the changes to your `teste_ingress_service.yaml`, apply the configuration:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f teste_ingress_service.yaml`

### **Verify the Service**

Once applied, check to see if the service was created successfully:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

You should see the `nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller` service listed, and it should now have names for the ports.

### **Deploy an Example Application and Ingress Resource**

After confirming that the Ingress controller service is running, you can deploy an example application and create an Ingress resource to route traffic. Here's how you can set up a simple NGINX application:

1. **Deploy an Example Application (NGINX):**

bash

Copy code

`kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image=nginx --port=80 kubectl expose deployment my-nginx --type=NodePort --port=80`

2. **Create the Ingress Resource:**

Now create the Ingress resource:

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: example-ingress   namespace: default spec:   rules:   - host: example.local     http:       paths:       - path: /         pathType: Prefix         backend:           service:             name: my-nginx             port:               number: 80`

Save the above configuration in a file (e.g., `example-ingress.yaml`) and apply it:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f example-ingress.yaml`

### **Access the Application**

If you added an entry to your `/etc/hosts`:

lua

Copy code

`192.168.15.12 example.local`

You should now be able to access your NGINX application via `http://example.local`.

Let me know if you encounter any more issues!

The error indicates that the `NodePort` you specified (`32000`) is already in use by another service in your cluster. To resolve this, you have two options:

### **Option 1: Let Kubernetes Automatically Allocate a NodePort**

You can simply omit the `nodePort` field, allowing Kubernetes to automatically assign an available port for you:

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller   namespace: ingress spec:   type: NodePort   ports:     - name: http       port: 80       targetPort: 80     - name: https       port: 443       targetPort: 443   selector:     app: nginx-ingress-microk8s`

### **Option 2: Manually Specify Different NodePorts**

If you prefer to specify custom NodePorts, select a different port that is not in use (for example, `32002` and `32003`):

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller   namespace: ingress spec:   type: NodePort   ports:     - name: http       port: 80       targetPort: 80       nodePort: 32002  # Choose a different NodePort     - name: https       port: 443       targetPort: 443       nodePort: 32003  # Choose a different NodePort   selector:     app: nginx-ingress-microk8s`

### **Apply the Configuration**

After making the changes, apply the configuration again:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl apply -f teste_ingress_service.yaml`

### **Verify the Service**

Once applied successfully, verify that the service is created:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc -n ingress`

This should list the `nginx-ingress-microk8s-controller` service with the ports configured.

### **Accessing the Ingress Controller**

Once the service is set up correctly, use the internal IP of your MicroK8s node (`192.168.15.12`) along with the assigned NodePorts to access the Ingress:

- For HTTP: `http://192.168.15.12:32002`
- For HTTPS: `https://192.168.15.12:32003`

    Make sure the pod is in the `Running` state.
    
2. **Check the NGINX Service:**
    
    Verify that your NGINX service is running and is properly exposed. If you followed the previous steps, you should have created an NGINX service. To check:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl get svc`
    
    Ensure that there’s an entry for your NGINX service.
    

### **3. Create an Ingress Resource**

If you haven't already done so, create an Ingress resource to route traffic from the Ingress controller to your NGINX service. Here’s an example configuration:

yaml

Copy code

`apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: example-ingress   namespace: default spec:   rules:   - host: example.local     http:       paths:       - path: /         pathType: Prefix         backend:           service:             name: my-nginx  # Change this to your actual NGINX service name if different             port:               number: 80`

1. **Save the Ingress Resource:**
    
    Save this configuration in a file named `example-ingress.yaml`.
    
2. **Apply the Ingress Configuration:**
    
    Run:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `kubectl apply -f example-ingress.yaml`
    

### **4. Update `/etc/hosts`**

If you used `example.local` as the host in your Ingress resource, you can add it to your local `/etc/hosts` file to test it:

bash

Copy code

`echo "192.168.15.12 example.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

### **5. Test Access**

Now, you can access your NGINX application through the Ingress controller. If you set up the Ingress correctly, try accessing:

- For HTTP: `http://example.local`
- For HTTPS: `https://example.local`

Or, if you prefer to access it directly via the NodePort, use:

plaintext

Copy code

`http://192.168.15.12:32010`

### **6. Check Logs for Issues**

If you're still not getting a response, check the logs of the Ingress controller for any errors:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl logs -n ingress -l app=nginx-ingress-microk8s`

This will give you insight into any issues that may be occurring with the Ingress routing.

### **7. Debugging Steps**

- Ensure that your firewall rules allow access to the ports.
- Verify that there are no conflicting services using the same ports.

To remove Gitea from your Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to delete both the Gitea service and the Gitea deployment (and possibly the persistent volume claims, if they exist). Here's how you can do that:

### **1. Delete the Gitea Service**

Run the following command to delete the Gitea service:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl delete svc gitea`

### **2. Delete the Gitea Deployment**

Next, you'll want to delete the Gitea deployment. First, list the deployments to ensure you have the correct name:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get deployments`

If the deployment is named `gitea`, delete it with:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl delete deployment gitea`

### **3. Delete Persistent Volume Claims (if applicable)**

If you created any persistent volume claims (PVCs) for Gitea, you might want to delete them as well. List the PVCs:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get pvc`

If you see any PVCs associated with Gitea, delete them:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl delete pvc <name-of-pvc>`

### **4. (Optional) Delete the Gitea Namespace (if created)**

If you set up Gitea in its own namespace (e.g., `gitea`), and you want to remove everything associated with that namespace, you can delete the namespace:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl delete namespace gitea`

### **Verification**

After performing these steps, verify that Gitea has been removed by checking the services and deployments again:

bash

Copy code

`kubectl get svc kubectl get deployments`

### **Final Cleanup**

If there are any lingering resources related to Gitea that you didn't identify earlier, you can delete them similarly by identifying their types and names.
