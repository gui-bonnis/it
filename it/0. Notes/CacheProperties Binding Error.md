Whar could cause this error Error creating bean with name 'spring.cache-org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.CacheProperties': Could not bind properties to 'CacheProperties' : prefix=spring.cache, ignoreInvalidFields=false, ignoreUnknownFields=true

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

This error message indicates that Spring Boot is having trouble binding properties to the `CacheProperties` bean. Specifically, the problem is related to the configuration properties under the `spring.cache` prefix.

Here are some common causes and steps to troubleshoot:

### 1. **Invalid Configuration Properties**

- **Check `application.properties` or `application.yml`**: Ensure that the properties under `spring.cache` are correctly defined and match the expected configuration format.
- **Unknown Properties**: If there are any misspelled or unknown properties, Spring Boot will fail to bind them.

### 2. **Missing Required Properties**

- Some properties might be required but missing. Ensure that all necessary properties under `spring.cache` are provided.

### 3. **Incorrect Property Types**

- Ensure that the property values match the expected data types. For instance, if a property expects a boolean, it should not have a string value like `"true"` or `"false"` instead of `true` or `false`.

### 4. **Configuration Issues with the Cache Implementation**

- If you are using a specific cache implementation (e.g., EhCache, Hazelcast, Redis), make sure that its dependencies are correctly included, and its configuration is accurate.

### 5. **Spring Boot Version Incompatibility**

- Ensure that your Spring Boot version is compatible with the other dependencies and that no breaking changes have been introduced.

### 6. **Invalid Configuration Files**

- If you are using a YAML configuration file, ensure that the file's structure and indentation are correct.

### Steps to Debug:

- **Review Stack Trace**: Check the full stack trace to identify the exact cause of the binding failure.
- **Enable Debug Logs**: Add `logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG` in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` to get more detailed logs.
- **Validate Configuration**: Double-check the properties being used and compare them against the official Spring Boot documentation for cache configuration.

If the issue persists, you may need to share the relevant configuration or error logs for a more specific diagnosis.

Can It be related with cache: type: caffeine caffeine: spec: expireAfterWrite=3600s

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Yes, the error could indeed be related to the configuration you've provided. Let's break it down:

### Configuration Analysis:

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   cache:     type: caffeine     caffeine:       spec: expireAfterWrite=3600s`

- **`spring.cache.type=caffeine`**: This tells Spring Boot to use Caffeine as the caching provider.
- **`spring.cache.caffeine.spec=expireAfterWrite=3600s`**: This is a Caffeine-specific configuration where you're setting the cache to expire entries 3600 seconds (1 hour) after they're written.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Property Binding Problem**:
    
    - If the property keys or values are not correctly recognized or supported by Spring Boot, this could lead to binding issues.
    - Double-check that the `caffeine.spec` syntax is correct and matches what Spring Boot expects.
2. **Incompatible Versions**:
    
    - If you are using a version of Spring Boot that doesn't fully support the properties you are configuring, or if there is a mismatch in dependency versions (e.g., an older version of Caffeine or Spring Boot), it could cause binding issues.
3. **Missing Dependencies**:
    
    - Ensure that the `Caffeine` dependency is correctly included in your project. If the dependency is missing, Spring Boot might fail to configure the cache properly.

### Steps to Troubleshoot:

- **Validate the `caffeine.spec`**:
    
    - Ensure the spec is correctly formatted according to the [Caffeine documentation](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine). The format should match the expected input for the `spec` parameter.
- **Check for Dependency Compatibility**:
    
    - Make sure your Spring Boot version and Caffeine library are compatible. You can check the Spring Boot documentation or dependency compatibility matrix for this.
- **Enable Debug Logs**:
    
    - To get more information about whatâ€™s going wrong, you can enable debug logs by adding `logging.level.org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache=DEBUG` to your configuration. This might help you see exactly where the binding fails.

If the configuration looks correct but the error persists, try commenting out the `spring.cache.caffeine.spec` line to see if the error still occurs. This can help you isolate the problem.

I do also have <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId> </dependency>

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Including the `spring-boot-starter-cache` dependency is correct and necessary for using Spring's caching abstraction. However, the issue might still arise if there are any compatibility problems, misconfigurations, or missing dependencies specific to the cache implementation (in this case, Caffeine).

### Things to Check:

1. **Caffeine Dependency**:
    
    - Ensure that the `Caffeine` library is also included as a dependency. The `spring-boot-starter-cache` provides the abstraction, but you need the actual caching library for Caffeine.
    
    xml
    
    Copy code
    
    `<dependency>     <groupId>com.github.ben-manes.caffeine</groupId>     <artifactId>caffeine</artifactId> </dependency>`
    
2. **Version Compatibility**:
    
    - Ensure that the versions of Spring Boot, Caffeine, and other dependencies are compatible. If you're using an older version of Spring Boot or Caffeine, it could cause issues.
3. **Correct Property Configuration**:
    
    - Double-check that the configuration in `application.properties` or `application.yml` is correct and aligned with the expected syntax and supported features.

### Updated Configuration Example:

If everything is configured correctly, your `application.yml` or `application.properties` should look like this:

#### `application.yml`

yaml

Copy code

`spring:   cache:     type: caffeine     caffeine:       spec: expireAfterWrite=3600s`

#### `pom.xml`

Ensure your `pom.xml` includes the following dependencies:

xml

Copy code

`<dependencies>     <!-- Spring Boot Cache Starter -->     <dependency>         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-cache</artifactId>     </dependency>          <!-- Caffeine Cache -->     <dependency>         <groupId>com.github.ben-manes.caffeine</groupId>         <artifactId>caffeine</artifactId>     </dependency> </dependencies>`

### Additional Debugging Tips:

- **Spring Boot Version**: Ensure that you're using a version of Spring Boot that supports the `spring.cache.caffeine.spec` property. Newer versions of Spring Boot generally have better support for caching with Caffeine.
    
- **Property Binding**: If the error persists, consider simplifying the configuration to see if the problem is specific to the `spec` property. For example, remove the `spec` configuration temporarily to see if the error disappears.
    
- **Check for Other Errors**: Look at the full stack trace and see if there are any other related errors that might provide more context.
    

If you still encounter issues, sharing more details from the stack trace or additional configurations might help narrow down the root cause.

The stack trace you've provided indicates that the Spring Boot application is failing to bind properties to the `CacheProperties` class during the initialization of the Spring context. This error typically points to a problem with the configuration in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

Given that the error is related to the `spring.cache` configuration, and considering your previous configuration using Caffeine, here are some possible causes and solutions:

### 1. **Incorrect Property Format or Value**

- Ensure that the `caffeine.spec` is correctly formatted. For instance, the value `"expireAfterWrite=3600s"` should follow the Caffeine specification format exactly.
- Try simplifying or temporarily removing the `spec` property to see if the error is directly related to that specific configuration.

### 2. **Spring Boot Version Compatibility**

- Check if the version of Spring Boot you are using supports the `spring.cache.caffeine.spec` property. Some older versions might not fully support this configuration.

### 3. **Unknown or Unsupported Property**

- The `ignoreUnknownFields=true` suggests that Spring Boot is set to ignore unknown fields, but the error could still arise if there's a property that doesn't match any expected configuration. Double-check for typos or misconfigurations in your cache-related properties.

### 4. **Configuration Files**

- Ensure that all your YAML or properties files are correctly formatted. YAML, in particular, can be sensitive to indentation.

### 5. **Enable More Detailed Logging**

- Add the following to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` to get more detailed logs related to configuration binding:
    
    properties
    
    Copy code
    
    `logging.level.org.springframework.boot.context.properties=DEBUG logging.level.org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache=DEBUG`
    

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Simplify Configuration**:
    
    - Temporarily remove the `caffeine.spec` property to see if the application starts without it. If it does, the issue is likely with that specific configuration.
2. **Update Dependencies**:
    
    - Ensure that you have the correct version of the Caffeine library and that it matches the version of Spring Boot you are using.
3. **Full Stack Trace Review**:
    
    - Look further down the stack trace for any additional clues. Sometimes, the real issue is revealed in later parts of the trace.
4. **Use Plain Cache Configuration**:
    
    - Try using a simpler cache configuration to rule out issues with advanced settings:
        
        yaml
        
        Copy code
        
        `spring:   cache:     type: caffeine`
        
    - If this works, gradually add back the more advanced settings like `caffeine.spec`.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to consider sharing the complete `application.yml` or `application.properties` and the specific versions of Spring Boot and Caffeine you're using for further analysis.

##### You said:

The error happens during the application usage, not during its load, also it is inside a kubernetes pod, not locally

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Given that the error occurs during application usage inside a Kubernetes pod and not during the initial application load, this changes the focus of troubleshooting. Here are some additional considerations and steps to address this issue:

### 1. **Environment-Specific Configuration**

- **Different Configurations**: Ensure that the configuration used in the Kubernetes environment is identical to the one used locally. Sometimes, environment-specific configurations (e.g., different `application.yml` or `application.properties` files for different profiles) might introduce inconsistencies.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: If you are using Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets to inject configurations, verify that they are correctly set and match what you expect.

### 2. **Kubernetes-Specific Issues**

- **Resource Limits**: Check if there are any resource constraints (memory, CPU) that might be causing the application to behave differently under load in the Kubernetes environment.
- **Network Issues**: Ensure that there are no network-related issues in Kubernetes that might be affecting cache operations, especially if the cache is distributed or interacts with other services.

### 3. **Dynamic Configuration or Property Updates**

- **Properties Reload**: If properties are being dynamically reloaded during runtime (for example, using Spring Cloud Config or some other dynamic configuration mechanism), ensure that this process is working correctly in the Kubernetes environment.
- **Environment Variables**: Kubernetes often relies on environment variables for configuration. Double-check that these are correctly set within the pod.

### 4. **Application Logic**

- **Cache Configuration Issues**: The issue might be triggered by specific logic in the application that manipulates or interacts with the cache. Review the parts of your application code that interact with the cache to ensure they are not introducing invalid configurations or states.
- **Conditional Logic**: If there is conditional logic based on the environment (e.g., different behavior in Kubernetes vs. local), ensure that this logic is correct and doesnâ€™t inadvertently cause issues.

### 5. **Logs and Monitoring**

- **Inspect Pod Logs**: Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to review the logs from the running pod at the time of the error. These logs might provide more context about what is happening when the error occurs.
- **Enable More Detailed Logs**: In the Kubernetes environment, ensure that detailed logging is enabled as mentioned earlier. This can help pinpoint the exact moment the error occurs and what might be triggering it.

### 6. **Kubernetes Config Differences**

- **Check for Overrides**: Kubernetes might override some properties with environment-specific configurations. Ensure that none of these overrides are causing the issue.
- **Volume Mounts**: If configuration files are mounted as volumes in Kubernetes, ensure that the files are correctly mounted and accessible.

### 7. **Pod Restart or Scaling**

- **Pod Restarts**: Check if the error occurs after a pod restart or when new pods are scaled up. This could indicate issues with cache state persistence or initialization that only appear after some time.

### 8. **Concurrency Issues**

- **Concurrent Requests**: The error might only manifest under concurrent usage or high load. Consider load testing the application locally with similar conditions to see if the error can be reproduced outside of Kubernetes.

### Action Plan:

1. **Compare Configurations**: Ensure that the configuration in Kubernetes matches the local configuration where the issue doesn't occur.
2. **Inspect Logs**: Gather logs from the Kubernetes pod to understand the context around the error.
3. **Monitor Resources**: Check Kubernetes resource usage to ensure there are no constraints that could cause unexpected behavior.
4. **Test Locally with Kubernetes Configurations**: If possible, replicate the Kubernetes environment locally to see if the issue can be reproduced outside of the cluster.

These steps should help you narrow down the root cause of the error in the Kubernetes environment. If you have more details about the specific behavior or error logs from the pod, it could provide further clues.

##### You said:

My scenario is fairly simple, I just use do cache a get mapping in a controller. The configuration is hardcode, I don't have any config service or shared storage. Also I don't have any other specifics in my application. Although sometime I can have some concurrency, but I would say 3 request per second

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Memory updated

Given that your scenario is fairly simple and involves caching a GET mapping in a controller with a hardcoded configuration, the issue might be related to how the cache is being managed during concurrent requests or how the configuration is applied in the Kubernetes environment.

### Possible Causes:

1. **Concurrency Handling**:
    
    - Even with low concurrency (3 requests per second), issues could arise if the cache is accessed or modified in a way that isn't thread-safe. This might happen if there are race conditions when the cache is being populated or accessed simultaneously.
2. **Pod-Specific Behavior**:
    
    - Since the error occurs only in the Kubernetes environment, it might be specific to how the application runs within the pod. Differences in resource availability or the way the application is containerized could expose issues not seen locally.
3. **Cache Configuration Application**:
    
    - Although you mentioned the configuration is hardcoded, it's worth checking if the properties are being applied correctly at runtime. Kubernetes environments can sometimes lead to configurations being ignored or overridden unexpectedly.

### Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Increase Logging**:
    
    - Add detailed logging around the caching logic in your controller to see how the cache behaves during concurrent requests. This could help identify if the issue is related to race conditions or other unexpected behavior.
2. **Simplify and Test**:
    
    - Temporarily disable the caching in the Kubernetes environment and see if the error still occurs. If it doesnâ€™t, then the issue is indeed tied to the caching logic or configuration.
3. **Check for Exceptions in Cache**:
    
    - Ensure that any exceptions related to cache operations are being logged. Sometimes, exceptions within the cache layer can be swallowed or not logged properly, leading to silent failures.
4. **Review Kubernetes Resource Allocation**:
    
    - Verify that the pod has sufficient CPU and memory resources allocated. Resource constraints can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially under concurrent access.
5. **Test with Increased Concurrency**:
    
    - Even though you expect only about 3 requests per second, try simulating a higher load to see if the issue is more likely to occur under increased concurrency. This can help identify if the problem is related to how the cache handles multiple requests.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Thread Safety**: Ensure that the cache implementation you're using is thread-safe, especially since you're working with concurrent requests.
- **Kubernetes-Specific Behavior**: Check if there are any differences in the Java runtime or other environment-specific settings within the Kubernetes pod compared to your local environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to narrow down the issue further. If the problem persists, capturing detailed logs or even profiling the application within the Kubernetes pod might provide more insights.

##### You said:

Should I keep the @EnableCaching at the Application main class or at my controller class?

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The `@EnableCaching` annotation should be placed on the main application class, not on the controller class. This annotation enables Spring's annotation-driven cache management across the entire application context.

### Why `@EnableCaching` Should Be in the Main Application Class:

1. **Global Configuration**:
    
    - Placing `@EnableCaching` in the main application class ensures that caching is enabled globally across the entire application. This allows all components (controllers, services, repositories, etc.) to participate in caching if needed.
2. **Application Context**:
    
    - The main application class is responsible for bootstrapping the Spring application context. By placing `@EnableCaching` here, you ensure that Spring initializes the necessary infrastructure to support caching before any beans, including controllers, are created.
3. **Centralized Configuration**:
    
    - Keeping such configuration annotations in the main application class helps maintain a clear and centralized configuration. This makes it easier to manage and understand how the application is configured.

### Example:

Hereâ€™s how you would typically structure it:

java

Copy code

`import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; import org.springframework.cache.annotation.EnableCaching;  @SpringBootApplication @EnableCaching public class MyApplication {     public static void main(String[] args) {         SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);     } }`

In your controller, you would then use caching annotations like `@Cacheable` to indicate which methods or results should be cached.

### Controller Example:

java

Copy code

`import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;  @RestController public class MyController {      @Cacheable("myCache")     @GetMapping("/data")     public String getData() {         // Simulate fetching data, which will be cached         return "Cached data";     } }`

By placing `@EnableCaching` in the main application class, you ensure that the entire application is set up to support caching, while individual methods or components can leverage caching where appropriate.

4o

##### You said:

I have this on my get Method @Cacheable(value = "integracaoCache", key = "'company-' + #codCompany", unless = "#result == null")

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The `@Cacheable` annotation you've used is well-structured and has some useful configurations. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

### Breakdown of the Annotation:

java

Copy code

`@Cacheable(value = "integracaoCache", key = "'company-' + #codCompany", unless = "#result == null")`

1. **`value = "integracaoCache"`**:
    
    - This specifies the cache name where the result of the method will be stored. The cache is identified by the name `integracaoCache`.
2. **`key = "'company-' + #codCompany"`**:
    
    - This defines the cache key using the method parameter `codCompany`. The key is dynamically generated as `'company-' + #codCompany`, so if `codCompany` is `123`, the cache key would be `company-123`.
    - This approach is useful for avoiding key collisions in the cache, especially if the cache might store data for different companies.
3. **`unless = "#result == null"`**:
    
    - This condition prevents caching of null results. If the method returns `null`, the result will not be cached. This is particularly useful to avoid caching empty or invalid data, which might otherwise cause issues if returned from the cache in future requests.

### Considerations:

1. **Cache Key Uniqueness**:
    
    - The `key` expression should ensure that each unique request results in a unique cache entry. Your current setup seems correct for this use case, as it combines a static prefix (`'company-'`) with a dynamic value (`#codCompany`).
2. **Caching Null Values**:
    
    - The `unless = "#result == null"` condition is a good practice as it prevents null values from being cached, which could lead to unexpected behavior if null results are returned from the cache in subsequent requests.
3. **Cache Size and Expiration**:
    
    - Since youâ€™re caching data for each company, ensure that the cache size and expiration settings are properly configured (likely in your Caffeine configuration). This prevents the cache from growing indefinitely, which could lead to memory issues.

### Example Usage in Context:

Hereâ€™s how it might look in your controller:

java

Copy code

`import org.springframework.cache.annotation.Cacheable; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;  @RestController public class MyController {      @Cacheable(value = "integracaoCache", key = "'company-' + #codCompany", unless = "#result == null")     @GetMapping("/data/{codCompany}")     public String getData(@PathVariable String codCompany) {         // Simulate fetching data, which will be cached         return fetchDataForCompany(codCompany);     }      private String fetchDataForCompany(String codCompany) {         // Implementation to fetch data for the company         return "Data for company " + codCompany;     } }`

### Tips:

- **Cache Miss Handling**: Ensure that the `fetchDataForCompany` method handles cases where the data might not be available (e.g., returns `null` or throws an exception) since these cases won't be cached.
    
- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Consider enabling cache statistics or logging to monitor cache hits and misses, which can help you understand how your cache is performing.
    

This setup should work well in your scenario, given the simplicity and concurrency level of your application.

##### You said:

What are the 2. Missing Required Properties Some properties might be required but missing. Ensure that all necessary properties under spring.cache are provided. that can be used or missed?

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

In a Spring Boot application, particularly when configuring caching, there are some properties that could be required depending on the caching provider and configuration you are using. If these properties are missing or incorrectly set, Spring Boot might fail to initialize the cache properly, leading to errors like the one youâ€™re encountering.

### Key Properties Under `spring.cache`

Here are the common properties under `spring.cache` that could be required or relevant depending on your setup:

1. **`spring.cache.type`**:
    
    - **Description**: Specifies the cache type to be used (e.g., `caffeine`, `redis`, `ehcache`, etc.).
    - **Possible Values**: `simple`, `concurrent_map`, `jcache`, `ehcache`, `hazelcast`, `infinispan`, `couchbase`, `redis`, `caffeine`, `guava`, `none`
    - **Example**:
        
        yaml
        
        Copy code
        
        `spring:   cache:     type: caffeine`
        
    - **Importance**: If this property is not set, Spring Boot might default to a basic cache implementation (`simple`), which might not be suitable for your needs.
2. **`spring.cache.cache-names`**:
    
    - **Description**: Defines the names of the caches to be managed by the caching provider. If you specify cache names, Spring Boot will initialize them at startup.
    - **Example**:
        
        yaml
        
        Copy code
        
        `spring:   cache:     cache-names: integracaoCache`
        
    - **Importance**: While not always required, explicitly defining cache names can help ensure that caches are correctly initialized and available when needed.
3. **Provider-Specific Properties**:
    
    - Depending on the cache provider you are using (e.g., Caffeine, Redis, EhCache), additional specific properties might be required to configure the cache correctly. Missing these properties can lead to initialization failures or runtime errors.

### For Caffeine:

If you are using Caffeine, the following properties might be necessary:

- **`spring.cache.caffeine.spec`**:
    - **Description**: Defines the Caffeine cache specification, such as expiration time, maximum size, etc.
    - **Example**:
        
        yaml
        
        Copy code
        
        `spring:   cache:     caffeine:       spec: expireAfterWrite=3600s,maximumSize=1000`
        
    - **Importance**: If the cache behavior is critical (e.g., time-based expiration), this property must be correctly set. Missing or incorrect specifications can lead to unexpected cache behavior.

### For Other Cache Providers:

If you were using other cache providers, you might need additional properties specific to those providers. For instance:

- **EhCache**:
    
    - `spring.cache.ehcache.config`: Path to the EhCache XML configuration file.
- **Redis**:
    
    - `spring.cache.redis.time-to-live`: The time-to-live (TTL) for cache entries.
    - `spring.cache.redis.cache-null-values`: Whether to cache `null` values.

### Common Missing Configurations:

1. **`spring.cache.type`**: If this is not set, Spring Boot might not use the intended caching provider, leading to potential misconfigurations or runtime issues.
    
2. **Provider-Specific Properties**: Failing to include necessary provider-specific properties, like the Caffeine `spec` or Redis TTL, might cause the cache to behave unexpectedly or not initialize correctly.
    

### Conclusion:

To ensure your cache is configured correctly, verify that:

1. **`spring.cache.type`** is set correctly to your intended caching provider.
2. **Provider-specific properties** like `spring.cache.caffeine.spec` are correctly defined.
3. **`spring.cache.cache-names`** is set if you need to predefine cache names.

If any of these are missing or incorrectly configured, it might lead to errors or unexpected cache behavior.

javascript

Copy code

`Error creating bean with name 'spring.cache-org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.cache.CacheProperties': Could not bind properties to 'CacheProperties' : prefix=spring.cache, ignoreInvalidFields=false, ignoreUnknownFields=true`

This error typically appears during the Spring application context initialization phase when Spring Boot is trying to bind the properties defined in your `application.yml` or `application.properties` files to the `CacheProperties` class. Here's when and why it might occur:

### When This Error Should Appear:

1. **Application Startup**:
    
    - **Initial Context Creation**: This error usually appears when the Spring application is starting up and trying to configure the caching system based on the properties provided under the `spring.cache` prefix.
    - **Binding Failure**: If there is a problem binding the properties to the `CacheProperties` object (e.g., a typo, missing required properties, or an incompatible value), Spring Boot will throw this error during startup.
2. **Dynamic Property Binding**:
    
    - **Configuration Reload**: If your application supports dynamic reloading of properties (e.g., using Spring Cloud Config or a similar mechanism), and the `spring.cache` properties are reloaded, the error could appear at that time if the new properties cannot be correctly bound.

### Why This Error Might Appear:

1. **Invalid or Missing Properties**:
    
    - **Invalid Values**: If a property under `spring.cache` is incorrectly set (e.g., using an invalid value or data type), Spring Boot will fail to bind the value to the corresponding field in `CacheProperties`.
    - **Missing Required Properties**: If certain required properties are missing (e.g., `spring.cache.type`), Spring Boot might not be able to configure the cache properly, resulting in this error.
2. **Unknown Fields**:
    
    - **Extra or Mistyped Properties**: If there are properties in your configuration that don't match any fields in `CacheProperties`, and `ignoreUnknownFields` is set to `false`, this error could be triggered. This is not the case in your error message since `ignoreUnknownFields=true`, but it's something to be aware of in other contexts.
3. **Environment-Specific Issues**:
    
    - **Different Profiles or Environments**: This error might appear in one environment (e.g., Kubernetes) but not another (e.g., local) if the configuration files differ, or if environment-specific configurations are missing or incorrect.

### How Often Should It Appear:

- **During Every Startup** (if the configuration issue is persistent):
    - If the root cause of the error is in your configuration files and not resolved, the error will appear every time the application starts, as the application context will always try to bind the same invalid or incomplete properties.
- **Only Once During a Configuration Change** (if properties are dynamically reloaded):
    - If your application supports dynamic configuration reloading, the error might only appear once when the problematic configuration is loaded.

### In Your Case:

Since you mentioned that the error occurs inside a Kubernetes pod during usage, but not during initial application load, this suggests that:

1. **Dynamic Context Refresh**: There might be a dynamic property refresh or some other trigger that causes Spring to rebind properties, leading to this error during application runtime.
    
2. **Conditional Configuration**: The error might be tied to a specific condition or path in your application's execution, possibly related to cache access under specific conditions.
    

### Summary:

This error should primarily appear during application startup when Spring is binding properties, or during any dynamic configuration refresh. If it appears later during application usage, it suggests a dynamic rebind is happening, possibly due to some runtime condition, or a delayed configuration issue specific to the environment (e.g., Kubernetes).

Given that the error typically occurs when Kubernetes pods are scaling or during deployment, it points to potential issues with the caching system's configuration or behavior under high concurrency, dynamic scaling, or incomplete initialization during pod startups. Here are some factors that could contribute to the issue:

### Potential Causes During Pod Scaling or Deployment:

1. **Incomplete Cache Initialization**:
    
    - **Pod Startup Timing**: During scaling or deployment, new pods are started, and if the cache system (like Caffeine) isnâ€™t fully initialized before requests hit the pod, Spring might fail to create or bind the `CacheProperties` bean properly.
    - **Race Conditions**: Multiple pods may attempt to initialize the cache simultaneously, leading to race conditions or configuration binding issues if there are shared resources or conflicting settings.
2. **Concurrency Issues**:
    
    - When multiple pods scale up and handle concurrent requests (e.g., during high load), and caching is involved, there might be concurrency problems, especially with the `@Cacheable` annotation and shared caches.
    - **Example**: If cache configurations are being read or modified by multiple instances at the same time, it could cause errors during the binding of cache properties.
3. **Kubernetes Deployment Behavior**:
    
    - **Rolling Deployments**: In Kubernetes, during rolling deployments, existing pods are terminated while new pods are spun up. If the cache configuration isn't correctly propagated to the new pods or thereâ€™s a mismatch between versions, it could lead to binding issues.
    - **ConfigMap or Secret Reloading**: If you're using a `ConfigMap` or `Secret` for your cache configuration, and it is being updated during a deployment, the new configuration might not be correctly applied, causing issues in the new pods.
4. **Missing or Inconsistent Cache Configuration in New Pods**:
    
    - **Environment Variables or Mounted Volumes**: If the new pods don't inherit the same environment variables or configuration files (like `application.yml`), they might be missing required `spring.cache` properties, causing the binding failure.
    - **Caching Provider**: Make sure the caching provider (Caffeine) is consistently available and properly initialized in all new pods.

### Recommendations:

1. **Pre-Warm Cache or Ensure Initialization**:
    
    - Consider ensuring that the cache is fully initialized before requests are served by the new pod. You might delay request processing until the application context, including cache, is fully initialized.
2. **Check Deployment Configuration**:
    
    - Verify that during pod scaling or deployment, the application configurations (especially cache settings) are consistent and correctly propagated to new instances. Ensure that any environment-specific settings in Kubernetes (e.g., `ConfigMap`, secrets) are not missing.
3. **Handle Concurrency with Cache**:
    
    - Investigate whether the issue is related to concurrency during scaling. You may need to review the way cache keys and cache stores are managed across multiple pods to prevent race conditions or configuration collisions.
4. **Pod Readiness Probes**:
    
    - Consider setting up Kubernetes readiness probes that prevent new pods from receiving traffic until they are fully initialized, including proper cache setup.
5. **Caching Logs and Metrics**:
    
    - Enable logging for cache operations and Spring Boot's property binding. This could give more insight into the exact moment and reason for the failure when new pods come online.

By following these steps, you can mitigate the likelihood of encountering cache binding errors during scaling or deployment in Kubernetes.
