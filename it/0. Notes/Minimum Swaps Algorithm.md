Can you help me to understand how to solve You are given an unordered array consisting of consecutive integers [1, 2, 3, ..., n] without any duplicates. You are allowed to swap any two elements. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order. in java

To solve this problem, you can use a **greedy approach** by counting the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array. Since the array contains unique integers from `1` to `n`, each integer ideally should be in the position `i-1` (i.e., `1` should be in position `0`, `2` should be in position `1`, etc.). By iterating over the array and swapping elements that are out of place, you can get the sorted array in the fewest steps.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Loop through the array**:
    - For each element, check if it's in the correct position.
    - If it's not, swap it with the element that should be in its place.
2. **Counting swaps**:
    - Each swap will help place at least one element in its correct position, so count each swap.
3. **Stop when sorted**:
    - Continue until all elements are in their correct positions.

### Java Code Implementation:

java

Copy code

`public class MinimumSwaps {     public static int minimumSwaps(int[] arr) {         int swaps = 0;         for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {             // While the element is not in the correct position             while (arr[i] != i + 1) {                 // Swap the current element with the element at its correct position                 int temp = arr[i];                 arr[i] = arr[temp - 1];                 arr[temp - 1] = temp;                 swaps++; // Increment swap count             }         }         return swaps;     }      public static void main(String[] args) {         int[] arr = {4, 3, 1, 2};         System.out.println("Minimum swaps needed: " + minimumSwaps(arr));     } }`

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Outer loop** iterates over each element in the array.
2. **Inner while loop** swaps elements that are not in their correct positions.
    - `arr[i] != i + 1`: checks if the element at index `i` is in the correct position.
    - If not, it swaps `arr[i]` with `arr[arr[i] - 1]` (the position it should be in).
    - Each swap brings one element to its correct position, so we increase the `swaps` counter.
3. **Return the `swaps` count** after the array is sorted.

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider the array `{4, 3, 1, 2}`:

- Initial array: `{4, 3, 1, 2}`
- `i = 0`: `4` is not in the correct position (should be at `3`). Swap `4` and `2`:
    - Array becomes `{2, 3, 1, 4}`.
- `i = 0`: `2` is still not in the correct position (should be at `1`). Swap `2` and `1`:
    - Array becomes `{1, 3, 2, 4}`.
- `i = 1`: `3` is not in the correct position (should be at `2`). Swap `3` and `2`:
    - Array becomes `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
- Now, the array is sorted in `3` swaps.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n)O(n)O(n), as each element is visited once, and at most one swap is performed per element to put it in the correct place.
