Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of topics related to the 12-Factor App methodology, which can guide you as you structure your Obsidian vault:

## 1. Codebase:
    
    - Single codebase per app with version control
    - Multiple deployments from one codebase
    - Branching strategies for managing different environments

## 2. Dependencies:
    
    - Explicitly declare dependencies using package managers
    - Isolate dependencies in an environment to avoid conflicts
    - Managing external dependencies effectively

## 3. Config:
    
    - Store configuration in the environment, not the code
    - Use environment variables for sensitive data
    - Techniques for managing different configs per environment

## 4. Backing Services:
    
    - Treat backing services like attached resources
    - Interchangeability of backing services (e.g., switch databases without code changes)
    - External vs. internal services and managing connections

## 5. Build, Release, Run:
    
    - Strict separation between build, release, and run stages
    - Understanding the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
    - Rollback strategies for releases

## 6. Processes:
    
    - Stateless processes and shared-nothing architecture
    - Application horizontal scalability (scaling out with more instances)
    - Managing session data in stateless apps

## 7. Port Binding:
    
    - Expose services via port binding (web server within the app)
    - Running standalone services without relying on external servers

## 8. Concurrency:
    
    - Scale out by running multiple instances of the app
    - Concurrency models, process types, and workload partitioning
    - Designing for high availability and load distribution

## 9. Disposability:
    
    - Fast startup and graceful shutdown of apps
    - Robustness in the face of process crashes
    - Strategies for improving disposability and resource cleanup

## 10. Dev/Prod Parity:
    
    - Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
    - Strategies for managing dependencies and minimizing drift between environments
    - Using automated testing to ensure parity

## 11. Logs:
    
    - Treat logs as event streams and aggregate them
    - Monitoring and alerting on log events
    - Log aggregation and analysis tools

## 12. Admin Processes:
    
    - Running administrative tasks as one-off processes
    - Script-based vs. command-line tasks for administration
    - Automating routine tasks, backups, and maintenance
