## Performance Optimization

- Memory Management and Garbage Collection
    - Understanding JVM garbage collection processes
    - Reducing unnecessary object creation and memory leaks
    - Using profiling tools (e.g., VisualVM, YourKit) to monitor memory usage
- Efficient Collection Use
    - Choosing the right collection (e.g., `ArrayList` vs `LinkedList`, `HashMap` vs `TreeMap`)
    - Avoiding unnecessary resizing of collections
    - Efficient iteration techniques
- Avoiding Unnecessary Synchronization
    - Using the `synchronized` keyword correctly
    - Using `java.util.concurrent` collections for better concurrency management
    - Optimizing multithreaded programs (e.g., using `ReentrantLock`, `Atomic` classes)
- Lazy Initialization
    - Implementing lazy loading patterns to improve startup time
    - Using `Optional` to avoid unnecessary object creation
- Caching and Memoization
    - Implementing simple caching strategies (e.g., `HashMap`, `WeakHashMap`)
    - Using external libraries for advanced caching (e.g., Caffeine, EHCache)
    - Implementing memoization in recursive methods
- Concurrency and Parallelism Optimization
    - Using `ExecutorService` for managing threads efficiently
    - Avoiding thread contention and deadlock
    - Optimizing thread pool sizes and work queues
- Minimizing I/O Operations
    - Batch processing of I/O tasks
    - Using efficient streams and buffering (e.g., `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`)
    - Asynchronous I/O (e.g., NIO, AIO)
- Algorithmic Optimization
    - Identifying performance bottlenecks in algorithms
    - Optimizing search and sort algorithms
    - Reducing time complexity (e.g., from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n))
    - Using Big-O notation to evaluate algorithm performance
