### 1. Coding Standards

- Java Naming Conventions
    - Class, method, variable, and constant naming

- Code Formatting
    - Indentation rules
    - Consistent use of whitespace
    - Bracket positioning (K&R style, Allman style)
- Commenting and Documentation
    - Javadoc usage
    - Commenting conventions for methods, classes, and complex code
    - Inline comments vs. block comments
- Consistent Code Structure
    - Method organization (e.g., constructors, getter/setter methods, utility methods)
    - Class and method length limitations
    - Grouping related fields and methods
- Avoiding Magic Numbers
    - Using constants and enums instead of hardcoded values
- Error Handling Conventions
    - Using proper exception handling (e.g., avoiding empty catch blocks)
    - Specific exception types and meaningful error messages
- Immutability
    - Creating immutable classes where appropriate
    - Understanding the benefits of immutability in Java
- Use of Access Modifiers
    - Choosing between `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `default` access
