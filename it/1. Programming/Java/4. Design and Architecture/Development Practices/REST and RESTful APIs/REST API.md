    - Configuring CORS to allow access from different domains
    - Securing APIs from unauthorized cross-origin requests
- API Security Best Practices
    
    - Input validation and sanitization
    - Avoiding common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
    - Secure API communication using HTTPS

### 5. Data Binding and Serialization

- JSON and XML Serialization
    - Mapping Java objects to JSON and XML using Jackson or Gson
    - Controlling serialization with @JsonProperty, @JsonIgnore (Jackson) or equivalent in other libraries
    - Handling complex objects, collections, and nested structures in responses
- Error Handling and Exception Management
    - Returning proper HTTP status codes on errors
    - Custom error responses with @ResponseStatus (Spring) or ExceptionMapper (JAX-RS)
    - Creating global exception handlers in Spring (using @ControllerAdvice) or JAX-RS
- Request Validation
    - Validating incoming data using Java Bean Validation (`@Valid`, `@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.)
    - Validating request bodies using JSR 303/380 (Bean Validation API)

### 6. Pagination and Filtering

- Pagination Techniques
    - Implementing pagination in REST APIs (using query parameters like `page` and `size`)
    - Handling large datasets efficiently with pagination
    - Using Spring Data Pageable or custom pagination solutions
- Filtering and Sorting
    - Designing endpoints for filtering resources (e.g., `/products?category=electronics`)
    - Sorting results with query parameters (e.g., `/products?sort=price,desc`)
    - Complex filtering with multiple parameters (e.g., date ranges, full-text search)

### 7. Testing REST APIs

    - Writing unit tests for REST APIs using JUnit and Mockito
    - Mocking HTTP requests and responses for testing controllers
