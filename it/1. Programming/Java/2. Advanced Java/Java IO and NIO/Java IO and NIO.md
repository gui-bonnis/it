Hereâ€™s a detailed list of topics for Advanced Java > Java IO and NIO:

## 1. Introduction to Java IO and NIO
    
    - Differences between IO and NIO
    - Blocking vs. Non-Blocking IO
    - Streams vs. Buffers

## 2. Java IO (java.io Package)
    
    - Input and Output Streams (`InputStream`, `OutputStream`)
    - File Handling (`File`, `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`)
    - Character Streams (`Reader`, `Writer`)
    - Buffered Streams (`BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`)
    - Object Streams for Serialization (`ObjectInputStream`, `ObjectOutputStream`)
    - Data Streams (`DataInputStream`, `DataOutputStream`)
    - Print Streams (`PrintStream`, `PrintWriter`)

## 3. Java NIO (java.nio Package)
    
    - Introduction to Buffers (`ByteBuffer`, `CharBuffer`, etc.)
    - Channels (`FileChannel`, `SocketChannel`, `DatagramChannel`)
    - Selectors for Non-Blocking IO
    - Path and File Operations (NIO2, Java 7+)

## 4. Buffers in NIO
    
    - Buffer Types and Their Usage
    - Buffer Methods (`flip()`, `clear()`, `rewind()`, etc.)
    - Direct and Non-Direct Buffers

## 5. Channels in NIO
    
    - Types of Channels (File, Socket, Datagram)
    - Reading and Writing with Channels
    - Transferring Data between Channels

## 6. Selectors and Non-Blocking IO
    
    - Introduction to Selectors
    - Using Selectors with Channels
    - Managing Multiple Channels with a Single Thread

## 7. File I/O with NIO (NIO.2)
    
    - Path and Files APIs
    - Working with Directories and Files (`Files`, `Paths`)
    - File Attributes and Metadata (`BasicFileAttributes`, `DosFileAttributes`)
    - Watching for Directory Changes with `WatchService`

## 8. Character Sets and Encodings
    
    - `Charset` and `CharsetEncoder`/`CharsetDecoder`
    - Encoding and Decoding in IO and NIO
    - Handling Different Character Encodings

## 9. Asynchronous File Channels
    
    - `AsynchronousFileChannel` for Non-Blocking File I/O
    - Reading and Writing Asynchronously
    - Using CompletionHandler and Future

## 10. Advanced Serialization
    
    - Custom Serialization with `writeObject()` and `readObject()`
    - `Serializable` vs. `Externalizable`
    - Transient Fields and Serialization UID
    - Performance and Security Considerations in Serialization

## 11. Best Practices in Java IO and NIO
    
    - Efficient Buffer and Channel Usage
    - Error Handling and Resource Management (Try-with-Resources)
    - Performance Optimization Techniques
