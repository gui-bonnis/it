Hereâ€™s a detailed list of topics for Core Java > Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

## 1. Introduction to OOP Concepts
    
    - Overview of Object-Oriented Programming
    - Key OOP Principles (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)

## 2. Classes and Objects
    
    - Defining Classes and Creating Objects
    - Class Members (Fields, Methods)
    - `this` Keyword
    - Object Lifecycle and Garbage Collection

## 3. Constructors
    
    - Constructor Basics and Types
    - Default, Parameterized, and Copy Constructors
    - Constructor Overloading
    - `super()` and `this()` Constructor Calls

## 4. Encapsulation
    
    - Data Hiding and Access Modifiers (Private, Protected, Public)
    - Getters and Setters
    - Benefits of Encapsulation

## 5. Inheritance
    
    - Basics of Inheritance and `extends` Keyword
    - Types of Inheritance (Single, Multilevel)
    - Method Overriding and `super` Keyword
    - Constructor Chaining in Inheritance
    - `final` Keyword with Classes and Methods

## 6. Polymorphism
    
    - Compile-Time (Method Overloading) and Runtime (Method Overriding) Polymorphism
    - Dynamic Method Dispatch
    - `instanceof` Operator
    - Type Casting and Upcasting/Downcasting

## 7. Abstraction
    
    - Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods
    - Interfaces and Multiple Inheritance
    - Differences between Abstract Classes and Interfaces
    - Default and Static Methods in Interfaces (Java 8+)

## 8. Inner Classes
    
    - Types of Inner Classes (Static, Member, Local, Anonymous)
    - Scope and Usage of Inner Classes
    - Benefits of Inner Classes

## 9. Object Class and Its Methods
    
    - `equals()` and `hashCode()` Methods
    - `toString()`, `clone()`, `finalize()`
    - `getClass()` and Reflection Basics

## 10. Java Annotations
    
    - Understanding Annotations (`@Override`, `@Deprecated`, etc.)
    - Built-in Annotations and Custom Annotations
    - Meta-Annotations (`@Retention`, `@Target`, etc.)

## 11. Best Practices in OOP Design
    
    - Designing with SOLID Principles
    - Avoiding Code Smells (e.g., God Object, Inappropriate Intimacy)
    - Effective Use of Composition Over Inheritance
    - Proper Use of Design Patterns
