# Welcome to My Knowledge Vault

Welcome! This vault is designed to serve as a structured knowledge base for my studies in programming, cloud infrastructure, software architecture, and beyond. The goal of this vault is to build a comprehensive resource that organizes complex topics into accessible, interconnected notes. As I document my learning journey here, I’ll also translate it into blog content, making these insights available to others interested in similar topics.

## [[Vault Organization]]

Each section in this vault represents a critical area in modern software development and cloud computing. Here’s a quick guide to what each folder covers and how it supports a well-rounded study of programming and system design.

### 1. [[Programming]]

This section contains focused studies on programming languages and fundamentals, with an emphasis on **Java**:

- **Core Java**: Covers essential Java concepts, such as OOP principles, core libraries, and data structures.
- **Advanced Java**: Examines concurrency, functional programming, and I/O, as well as newer Java features.
- **SQL and Databases**: Delves into relational and NoSQL databases, schema design, optimization, and query practice.

### 2. [[Cloud]]

This area explores foundational cloud and infrastructure knowledge to support robust, scalable applications:

- **Kubernetes**: Notes on cluster management, networking, storage, and deployment automation using MicroK8s and Helm.
- **CNCF**: Coverage of CNCF projects like Prometheus and Fluentd, with insights into how they enhance cloud-native apps.
- **Cloud Design Patterns**: Patterns and best practices, including Event Sourcing and Circuit Breakers, for building resilient services.
- **Performance and Monitoring**: Strategies and tools for monitoring, tracing, and optimizing infrastructure.

### 3. [[Software Architecture and Design]]

A deep dive into software architecture principles, from the **12-Factor App** methodology to **microservices and distributed systems** patterns. This section includes:

- **Design Patterns**: Both traditional patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory) and modern, scalable patterns for distributed systems.
- **Best Practices**: Key concepts such as SOLID principles, coding standards, and performance tuning.

### 4. [[DevOps and Deployment]]

This section focuses on streamlining development and deployment:

- **CI/CD**: Continuous integration and deployment practices, GitOps workflows, and automation pipelines.
- **Containerization**: Docker usage, image optimization, and security best practices.
- **Load Testing and IaC**: Load testing tools like JMeter and best practices in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform.

### 5. [[Projects]]

Documented end-to-end projects where I apply theoretical knowledge. Each project contains detailed descriptions of planning, architecture, and reflections on challenges and solutions.

### 6. [[Resources and References]]

A collection of quick-access resources, including cheat sheets, summaries from books and blogs, and glossaries for domain-specific terms.

### Vision for the Blog

As I continue building this vault, I'll share my learning journey on a blog, following this structure. My goal is to create a well-rounded guide, accessible to both beginners and experienced developers, covering each topic in depth and offering practical insights.

Happy studying!
