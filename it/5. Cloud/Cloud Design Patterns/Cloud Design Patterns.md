### Cloud-Native Design Patterns

These patterns are tailored for cloud-native architectures, which are designed for the cloud environment (e.g., Kubernetes, serverless):

1. Serverless Architecture
2. Cloud-Native Architecture
3. Event-Driven Microservices


## 1. Serverless Architecture
    
    - Overview of Serverless Architecture
    - Benefits and Challenges of Serverless
    - Java-based Serverless Frameworks (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
    - Event-Driven Serverless Architectures

## 2. Cloud-Native Architecture
    
    - Introduction to Cloud-Native Principles
    - Microservices, Containers, and Cloud-Native in Java
    - Cloud-Native Design Patterns
    - Using Java with Cloud-Native Technologies (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)

## 3. Event-Driven Microservices
    
    - Event-Driven Design for Microservices
    - Using Kafka, RabbitMQ, or JMS in Java for Event-Driven Communication
    - Benefits and Challenges of Event-Driven Microservices
